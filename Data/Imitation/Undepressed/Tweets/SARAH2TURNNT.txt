RT @imagin8ion: @SARAH2TURNNT üíï to this whole thread. Just... üíï
and please please remember this, you are not your mistakes. If nobody is proud of you, I am. If you have no one, I'm here.
Try writing, try creating things, try music. try something but as long as you're trying that's literally all that matters.
poetry helped me not kill myself. paining (even though I'm shitty at it) helped me so many nights when I didn't want to be here.
Trust me, your mental health MATTERS. YOU. FUCKING. MATTER and if you feel like you have nobody, find creative outlets.
it's not okay to be like this, trust me. Not talking is not a good way to cope and overtime, the feeling of being alone will eat you alive.
saying I'm ‚Äúokay‚Äù or I'm ‚Äúfine‚Äù and putting a fake smile on my face because I legitimately don't want to be a burden on anyone.
my depression isn't staying in bed and doing nothing. my depression is overworking myself, not eating. not sleeping. barely talking....
This feeling has literally eaten me alive for so many years and still to this day because people don't understand what I deal with.
I've always felt like if I fuck up, I'm a disappointment. If I disappoint people I care about, the love stops. That I'm not good enough.
people don't understand how heavy of a toll it is when you constantly feel like no matter what you do... it's wrong or you're a failure.
support is something I've never really had. I've never gotten an ‚ÄùI'm proud of you‚Äù or ‚Äúyou're growing, keep doing a good job‚Äù
unfortunately, I'm the type of person that will break themselves apart constantly trying to keep other people whole and happy.
I'm very vocal about my mental health issues and my depression. Maybe it's just me but I feel like in this season everything gets worse.
People literally take my kindness as convenience and only fuck with me when they want something
the day I find a man to love me unconditionally and treat my like a princess I'll be set. Until then, I'll continue to do it for myself.
If I send you something I want and you don't send me a god damn order confirmation.. you need to move out my face.
remember, the same energy you give me is the same energy I'm giving you.

If you're not secure within yourself, working on/growing yourself.. your relationships/friendships will always fall short.
you have to be comfortable with being by yourself instead of searching for comfort within other people.
a side note: be kind to others. you never know what people are going through.. even if they aren't kind to you, be the light that you need.
life will be an array of good/bad things that will impact your future in so many ways. take it with a light heart and keep pushing.
always take the time to understand others and don't let others opinions define you or your perspective on things.

Others, instead of working on a problem or growing within themselves. They would rather replace you and forget but with pain comes growth.
it's interesting to see how people deal with hurt in different ways. My way is growing and working in myself.. because I am my investment.
to everyone that has taken me for granted and given up on me: I appreciate you so much for making me stronger than you'll ever know.
constantly reminding myself that if it's meant to be, it will be. the universe will always bring things into my life when they're necessary.
I've realized this over having an array of unhealthy friendships/relationships. It's okay to have a life with someone and your own too.
It's not healthy to always be around people and never be alone. Solitude is very necessary especially for growth within yourself.
when I say I'm doing me, that's literally it. I'm not searching for anyone to complete me. I am finding myself and working on me.

mentally I'm past the point of hurt to where I can't even cry about certain things anymore.
Pride will ruin so many things.
sometimes you're not going to be okay. sometimes it's going to be hard, that pain will silence and you'll get used to it.
the solitude that comes after losing your lover/best friend is heartbreaking yet empowering.

@mochahontes I'm honestly so down for that
I need a break. I need a week off. I need to do something that makes me happy and takes my mind off of everything I'm stressing over.
and that's something that's always going to hurt. knowing you're fighting and giving your all to someone and they'll never change.
I believe that relationships only last when he cares more. no matter what you do, say and/or feel. If he's done unfortunately that's it.
I need to kill off the parts of my life that I don't like. I need to surround myself with genuine love and people who won't hurt me.
right now, at this very moment. I don't like the life I'm living. I don't like the ‚Äúlove‚Äù from people I'm receiving or like this feeling.
I just want to be happy, literally. I want to be unbelievably happy at every moment but there's times like this where life gets hard.

Sometimes I need to hear that someone loves me. I need to hear that I'm doing a good job. I need to hear that things aren't my fault.
I just genuinely feel like once I disappoint someone then the love stops. I genuinely feel like people are mad at me even when they aren't.
A lot of times I have to make sure people aren't mad at me. I have to ask if people still love or care about me. it's not to be irritating.
Another thing this a big part of my anxiety is reassurance. Sometimes I ask things multiple times. Sometimes I repeat myself a lot.
I don't know why but it's very easy for people to guilt trip me and eventually I'll beat myself up over it and it sucks that I deal with it
Sometimes I just feel like I'm a disappointment and it's my fault that people treat me the way they do and it makes me anxious
