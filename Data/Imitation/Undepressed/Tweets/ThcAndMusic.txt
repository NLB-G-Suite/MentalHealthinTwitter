 Waters you again.....
u will drink days after the storm.  not just enough to get you thru.
so actually over watering is keeping a puddle of water to absorb slowly from.. comes down fast. but it helps in the long run.
Even if th3y get to much water they still normally grow thru the excess puddle around em.. just takes longer for the soil to absorb.
I don't wanna change you.  
I wanna push you to evolve.  
 #WateringYou #StormsOverWater sometimes ..
 Be gentle with flowers.  but no this.
