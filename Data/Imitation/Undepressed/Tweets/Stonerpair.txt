@fiteqmom love that! I actually heard that in the city here they're making their parking meters solar! Super cool
@TeenyHippies of course! We got 2 batteries when we moved in &amp; they were $150 each. Big things like the fridge run straight off the panels

@TeenyHippies a ton of electricity everyday so it stores up in the batteries. Winter is a bit rough but summer is a breeze
@TeenyHippies we have 5 panels &amp; 4 batteries. Cloudy days do effect it but we have a generator we use if we run out but we don't use
☮️Take a compliment &amp; give a compliment☮️
Another reason to consider going solar, you don't lose power during storms! It's quite nice
We officially have 31" of snow &amp; it's still snowing 😶 it's kind of awesome
Another snow day. That means a Harry Potter marathon ⚡️
