If you are so proud to be Latino then you would learn some history about your country and learn how yr pale skin ancestors ended up Latino
If you can't see past the term Latino in order to see the intersections that latinidad has then you are racist :)
And no your culture is not being erased when someone calls you a white Latino :) lol they called you a Latino
White latinxs hold the expected beauty standards, white latinxs are dominant on Latino tv and pop culture, white latinos oppress and kill
White supremacy affects and rules Latin American countries same as the United States
Y'all can experience prejudice because of your nationality and language but it's not the same thing as systematic racism :)
A quick reminder for all the sensitive white latinxs out there :) culture does not equal race, nationality does not equal race :)
@ValleyChicana latinxs people share certain cultures and languages but we don't all share a race and we all don't share the same privileges
@ValleyChicana it's called intersectionality

Stand up for people with MI that carry lots of stigmas like psychosis disorders and personality disorders not just depression and anxiety
A thread https://t.co/8htAJGvBot
For those living with a MI remember that you are not a bad person, you are not broken, you are not a burden. You are strong and surviving ‚ù§
Communication, love, empathy, and support can go a long way in the survival of someone living with a mental illness
At that time of my suicide attempt I lacked a good support system and resources.
They would tell me I was making things up and that I was just too sensitive. They made me feel crazy.
I had people in my life who would constantly invalidate my fears, triggers, symptoms.
January of this year I tried to kill myself and was in the hospital for 2 weeks. I am diagnosed with major depression and bi polar disorder.
As small and insignificant as they may seem to you they are extremley real for a person with a MI. Validate them!
Never invalidate the fears and triggers of a person with mental illness when they are trying to communicate them with you.
Have a talk with your loved ones about what makes you feel anxious, paranoid, irritable, what triggers your episodes, ect.
We have triggers and things that set us off into episodes, communication can help avoid this.
Communicating about your mental illness and symptoms is an extremely important part of surviving.
But it is crucial to talk about our mental illness and the people in our lives should make room for this talk.
We are taught to hide our mental illness, to not talk about it, to feel ashamed of ourselves for having a disorder.
You are not a bad person if your mental illness makes it hard to control your mood and emotions. Those are symptoms they are not you.
Check in with them and ask them how you can help them when their symptoms are acting up.
Suppport your loved ones who are living with a mental illness by learning and being informed about their illness.
