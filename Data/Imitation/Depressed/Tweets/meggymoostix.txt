Although a solar eclipse is incredible regardless of percentage, totality is truly an amazing and unique experience.
But, the sun is so bright that even 1% of it showing (99% solar eclipse) will produce 10,000 times the light of the full moon.
During a 100% solar eclipse, the moon will completely cover the sun. Day becomes night. The solar annulus appears. https://t.co/eTASeJRyCY
