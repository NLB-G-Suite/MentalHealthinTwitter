So if someone tells you they got raped, don't respond "are you sure?" just because u don't wanna believe that person is capable of that.

What I'm saying is DONT SLEEP ON MODELING/PHOTOGRPAHY/STYLING
Like if the model doesn't know what to do, you have to be able to direct them. And it all goes back to knowledge of modeling which is HARD!
Especially as a photographer like having a model who knows what's up is SO critical to the success or failure of a shoot. That and direction
People underestimate how difficult modeling is. Like it's not as easy as just jumping in front of a camera and staring straight🙄
