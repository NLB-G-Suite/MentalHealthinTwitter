There's a reason why Will Ferrell's Bush is more remembered than than Hammond's or Hartman's Sinatra more than Piscopo's.
Which speaks to Hammond's skill as an impressionist but doesn't necessarily translate to good sketch comedy or satire.
Hammond's impression was accurate but not as funny as Baldwin's, which is more mocking/over the top.

I like that the Steelers official hashtag is the same as Bud Light's old slogan because both things I know are bad but still I enjoy.
One might argue that having to wear one on the ass your next at bat is a better deterrent than a penalty.
While the NFL has a literal on field penalty for "excessive" celebrations.
I like when people cite "THE UNWRITTEN RULES" and a lack of "fun" as why baseball's popularity is declining.

If this country wants a song about a battle in Baltimore to be the anthem, it should just be McNulty and Bunk saying "fuck" over and over.
America lost battles to Canadians, not the British. As a nation, we should collectively repress this memory.
