Sometimes I feel utterly powerless during all these Trump fiascos. I've been battling rare diseases since 2015. Been too sick to protest.
Getting work done but not recovering as quickly as I want.. happy to have a stack of books to escape to. Reading is like eating to #writers.

@Ladyuvthelake thank you! I will do my best
My heart breaks to read the news. All I feel is love for the brave protesters who fight for equality, healthcare, and #resistance.
Won't be on here much due to health and a need for calm and sanity.
The cyst is called a Choledochal Cyst and it's very rare and can be very complex. Will be getting an MRI to start process in a few weeks.
Gallbladder is out but there is a cyst in my bile duct that will require later surgery by a specialist. It's very dangerous. :-(

Dems were "singing" because they think the AHCA is a career killer. Well, it's also a person-killer, and that gloating was hurtful. @dccc
I'm a lefty and I was disgusted with the Dems singing after the AHCA passed its first hurdle.
I am going to try to be mindful of my own empathy and showing it more often, no matter who it is or who I think they voted for. #lovewins
Quit rejoicing in other's people's miseries and troubles just because you disagree with them. We're all human, but where is our empathy?
You can't poor-shame and pretend to want to help the poor next time the election comes around. That doesn't work in urban areas, either.
Keep seeing people poor-shaming and hoping the Montanans lose its healthcare. There's a HUGE problem in that mentality.
