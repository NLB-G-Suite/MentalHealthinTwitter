🎶 Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy 🎶
🎶 'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love 🎶
🎶 Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it 
My love, they are the hunters, we are the foxes 
And we run 🎶
🎶 Something happens when everybody finds out 
See the vulture circling in dark cloud 
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out 🎶
🎶 So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed. 🎶
🎶 The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color 🎶
