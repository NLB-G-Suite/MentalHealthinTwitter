How da hell did the Saints pull off that signing $28M guaranteed ....I need answers here.
@coasterfreek yea but his entire contract doesn't count against the yearly cap right? Just the money guaranteed?

@Cwarlick_in_OKC that blog won't load for me. What are you trying to say?
This is the deepest NBA draft since 03' IMO. Knicks should be trying to get any kind of 1st rd pick.

JR Smith the immortal journeyman, desert thirsty, weed smoking, 3 pt choking loser just cost us the game.
I don't blame Udrih on that. JR put him in a bad situation with the clock running down.
This team's IQ is low as fuck my nigga. How do you not hold the ball there? #knicks

@Fundamentals345 as good as 2K video looked, they are really just showcasing the graphics. Gameplay looks like current-gen.
I honestly don't know what to make of the Knicks this season. The future is too unpredictable.
Honestly Mike Woodson might be fired pretty soon. This is unacceptable. Knicks have 0 discipline and look lost half the time.
RT @knicks81: Mike woodson with his garbage ass iso ball offense
Knicks look just like the Giants this year. BAD. What happened to these guys?
RT @JADubin5: There's the downside to Kenyon Martin having to play center. He's not a good rebounder.
RT @Mr_Clutch_NYK: This has to be the worse Knick game I've seen in years...
WTF is up with the Knicks and not being able to take the lead. I feel like the Bobcats put a spell on them or something.
Andrew Wiggins alley-oop. I can get used to that. #kubball
I'm hella frustrated with the Knicks right now. I've turned this game off three times already.

Knicks just keep calm and win the game.
Melo has like a 3-inch vertical. No ups.
Everytime a team starts making a run against the Knicks, they immediately go into Iso ball.
Tyson Chandler is all over the place tonight.
Yep RT @DisBeNat The bucks aint shit lol
Knicks basketball at its finest, I'm loving the fast breaks.
RT @KG_NYK: You guys are pathetic. Knicks up playing a good first game and all you wanna do is dig on Bargnani. KNICK FANS. You disgust me.
Knicks need to play like this every game. Enough of the 3pt shootout offense that we had last year.
Damn Udrih crossed the shyt out of the man but couldn't make the layup
Knicks can get away with playing Bargnani at center for this game.
Now the Knicks want to go to the basket...where was this in the preseason?
Brandon Knight out for the year already.....

Do the Knicks always just have to give the ball to a predictable Melo fadeaway. There are other people on the team. Run a play, something.
Of course JR makes the halfcourt shot but can't hit wide open mid-range jumpers.
Knicks offense looks pretty average, but that defense is on point this game. Biggest improvement is Bargnani.
Why does Amare have a blond streak in his hair...did I miss something?
@DaBigTyme he too busy telling people he got rebounds when he ten feet from getting the ball
Melo: I got it now get the f*** outta here
I luv me some Rosie Perez even if she is from Brooklyn.

I hope the fans boo him everytime he checks into the game. J.R. shouldn't be trying to play the system to get richer.
@DaBigTyme LOL you be on Woody man.
Knicks just said F U to all the fans who come to see NBA talent players play on a nightly basis.
Knicks should of held onto Jeremy Tyler though, that was a big surprise as well.

Why did @KyrieIrving have to do the Knicks like that in tha Live trailer.

@PSDnews Hey my Seahawks atleast had a 45 yd TD at the end.
The Jets are always good for a laugh every game.
Geno Smith went full blown Sanchez
Jets resorting to bush league tactics
So this a new thing in the NFL to fake injuries?
oh so Geno Smith IS Mark Sanchez huh
Jets are still in it.
Geno is rattled.
@ChrisHansenNFL somebody needs to talk to league office. They need to scrap the Thursday night game.
I'm glad I picked up Edelman off fantasy but fell he should have a TD by now.
RT @Ayo_Rush: Amendola plays and we're down two touchdowns right now.
That was a clear makeup call on the hold
@Lamb_and_tuna You really giving us a play by play of a Superman porno?
Geno looks pretty good 2 me. He just has some rookie jitters of course.
Edelman was the best FA fantasy pickup in weeks.
If you haven't already...pick up Julian Edelman in fantasy if Amendola has to miss time.
Yo I just watch Blaine Gabbert's film from Sunday against Kansas City. He's gotta be the worst QB in the league.
Chris Smith is so garbage, what the hell do these Knicks see in this guy? He couldn't even drop 15 points in Summer League on any occasion.
RT @SportsCenter: BREAKING: Jets QB Mark Sanchez is "likely to have surgery" that will end his 2013 season. (via @mortreport)

@RealMikeRob so when you coming back to the Seahawks or did u sign with someone yet?
Why do teams always call the ice the kicker timeout, it never works.
Well Philip Rivers turned back into...well Philip Rivers.
WOOWWWWW
Nice fake punt Texans
Matt Schaub might beat out A. Rog in fantasy this week lol. I didn't wanna take that risk though.
Texans are back in it.
Wow Ray Lewis is a great NFL analyst...I'm kinda shocked.
Vintage Michael Vick
I had a chance to draft McCoy...damn man
Take RGIII out of the game man, its just getting bad now.
RT @tarmosino: Get RGIII out of there
@JDBurkeOV yea they were decent last year and this is first game of the year but u have a point too. NFL just usually isnt run at this pace.
I'm waiting to hold judgement on the Eagles until they play a decent defense.
If the Eagles had a good offensive line they'd could definitely be a playoff team again.
Redskins executing the old fake the injury trick
RT @robinlundberg: Redskins are using the Giants playbook from last night.
Yo these Redskins are making the Giants look good from yesterday.
Wow what a play by the Eagles.
RGIII that was a terrible terrible throw.
These Philadelphia Eagles are fun to watch man. Vick looks great.

Tony Romo still hilarious.

Another fumble another Cowboys possession. This is unreal.
The Giants are a joke this year geez.
No spoilers :) RT @tarmosino #BREAKINGBAD
and down goes Romo....
To be fair almost any NFL QB could of made that throw lets not act like it was something special.
The Giants finally score.
RT @AP: BREAKING: Serena Williams wins US Open for 17th Grand Slam singles title.
Yes Peyton Manning is good but he's no Aaron Rodgers.

Kaepernick is looking good this week but wait until week 2.

Mike Wallace might of been the worst FF draft player ever. I got caught up by the contract they gave him.
Seahawks better gameplan for Boldin. Kaepernick is in love.
Hey Packers you might wanna cover Anquan Boldin
RT @DangeRussWilson: Big time first win on the road by us @Seahawks  Great battle till the end! #GoHawks
Where is that guy in OKC who said Russell Wilson was sorry? Looked pretty good for the tune of 300+ yards
The Seahawks should be up by 10-14 points but penalties have hurt them.
Russell Wilson da gawd. Perfect throw.
Doug Baldwin just made Sportscenter top 10 with that catch. Damn.

Now Clark fumbles for no reason at all. This game is hilarious
A touchback cuz he dropped the ball too early HAAAAAA
Ok Peyton you throw a GREAT deep ball at times.
#noassatall RT @NFL_Memes I'm SO glad the #NFL is back. Here is a pretty good reason: http://t.co/kGzWUfcUpG
This game got ugly quick and I'm looking like a fool for all the stuff I typed about it
These Ravens receivers are dropping everything, can't blamed Flacco on that one.
What do you know P. Manning gets another free gift.
RT @ChrisHansenNFL: Drops are killing Flacco.
How many breaks will Peyton Manning get this game?
Clark just robbed Flacco of a TD
Hope she takes everything from him too RT @TMZ Earlier: George Zimmerman -- Report: Wife Files for Divorce http://t.co/RdqWl3Gy5D
Peyton Manning throws a horrible deep ball.
The Ravens gift-wraped that TD for Peyton
Peyton Manning got lucky. That ball would of likely been picked off.
Wes Welker hearing footsteps LOL.
@heartland_ only one td. He'll get picked later in the night.
Will the real Peyton Manning please stand up.
Baltimore scrap that play from the playbook immediately.
Sorry nfl analysts, its early on but Denver shows no signs of being ready for the Super Bowl esp. with that soft D.
Wes Welker everything....
People are still dissing Flacco? Yea he makes some bad mistakes but the guy is a very solid QB
I don't think they are ever gonna play this damn NFL game. The league is being overly cautious with this lightning stuff.
