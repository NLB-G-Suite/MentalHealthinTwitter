@davehust let me know if it works.
Okay: DM me your email address if you want a Google+ invite. I think I figured out how to send them.
@susiekline Aw, thanks!
@punkrockpatriot mailing it to yourself is fine, or just writing or scanning it into the computer.
@punkrockpatriot there are ways to tell if the date information has been tampered with, plus the piece will have references/witnesses.
@punkrockpatriot If validity of copyright ownership came into question, the original file or a link to the original article will do.
@punkrockpatriot can't find it in the FAQ, but did find this link: http://dwoe.us/l2Za9H - This isn't really needed in the digital age.
@punkrockpatriot I think the FAQ actually addresses the mailing it to yourself method. Let me look!
@punkrockpatriot if you want to SUE for damages if someone infringes on your copyright, you need to register it w/the US Copyright Office
@punkrockpatriot Okay, so... that's sort of right.  A copyright is automatic upon the work's creation.

@miriamshope subscribe to comments allows readers to get a response when anyone adds a new comment to the post.
@miriamshope comment reply notification sends out an email reply when you reply to the comment, whether they've subscribed or not.
@miriamshope make sure you get a caching plugin too (one is on my list, of course) because a lot of plugins will slow your site down!
@dylanhowell I had it wrong. that was avg speed per KB. Yours loads in 3.41s, mine in 1.5s. Not too many plugins unless it causes problems
@dylanhowell Example, I just did a speed test of my site and your site. Yours was .01, mine was .02.  I'll live with the difference!
@dylanhowell I know. Speed tests on my site are acceptable. I tried to cut some the other day and couldn't bring myself to.
@jesseoguns It didn't. It led to my FB home page, thus me saying the link wasn't working as you anticipated...
@miriamshope If something happens to those (unless you go in and delete them all) it's usually the host responsible to restore anyway.
@miriamshope If you're talking about the photos/files you upload, ask your host if they keep backup copies they can restore, that's easiest.
@miriamshope You don't need to back up the files unless you hack them. You can just upload the whole package again if needed.
@jesseoguns Your link doesn't work. I think everyone should have an elevator speech ready for a few situations. It helps.

@punkrockpatriot I think what you should have done is sent that magazine an invoice for using your photo.
@punkrockpatriot I have another post at a different site on how to protect your photos here: http://dwoe.us/fnDyjM
@punkrockpatriot it's illegal. Suing over it, however, is pretty much impossible unless you've REGISTERED the work with the copyright office
@punkrockpatriot Creative Commons allows others to use  your work ONLY if they credit you. What that mag did was copyright infringement.

@punkrockpatriot .... but I also don't think it's worth making a derivative of someone's work unless it's licensed for it.
@punkrockpatriot well, he was making money off it, so it's more than just "fanart". I don't think the Jay Maisel side is right....
If you know me, you know I love Creative Commons. I've seen many people CC license their BLOGS and I don't get that. Tell me why you do it.
Fair use of a copyrighted work is a really tricky thing.  This isn't the first time I've heard of it going sour.... http://fb.me/15hxjWnhB

@miriamshope you want your search bar to be at the TOP of your page, or top of your sidebar. If I can't find it, no one else will either.

@esophoenix The FF self-portrait theme is what made me decide to do a self-portraiture project this year.
@esophoenix I've done self-portraits before and also reflections. Had a sub-cat in self-portraits, 'togs w/cameras http://dwoe.us/gr3lLq
@amy36k woo-hoo!  Congrats for wining!
@esophoenix I love pretty much any non-mirror reflected self-portrait. (tho I like mirror reflected self-portraits too..)
@esophoenix I love eye reflections! Especially love it when I get myself in the reflection of my kids' eyes.
@amy36k I bet it will! You have to start somewhere! All those successes will build confidence and will power!
@esophoenix yeah. if it was for ME, I probably would live with it, but I can't watch my kids go through it. :(  Anything for them.
@esophoenix it's all this crap we're exposed to in this world. Both my kids had a rough start to life. I'm sure that didn't help.
@esophoenix it's expensive tho. $10/bottle which lasts us about a week for one boy.
@esophoenix it's pretty much Eucerin with a bunch of moisturizers added. Doesn't feel filmy or gunky on the skin either. Very silky!
@esophoenix we have gone through every product in the book, including prescription steroid creams (those didn't do a LICK for my oldest)
@esophoenix we use Cortisone 10 for eczema. It's the ONLY thing so far that nearly extinguishes the rashes and itching!
@esophoenix we used to use that... it's the 2nd best thing for us. Let me go find the name of the new stuff we're getting that works better.
My @SITSGirls article tomorrow will cover how to use your stats to analyze searches to solve problems #SITS31DBBB @MiriamsHope
@miriamshope I LOVE ANALYZING! (I'm an analyst.) Do you use any stats trackers for your site? Install Google Analytics stat! #SITS31DBBB
@esophoenix it'll probably take years for my body to adjust. My hair likes the dry conditions, however.  Give and take!
@esophoenix The soles of my feet have become unbelievably dry since moving from Atlanta to Ft. Worth last year. Nothing helps that either!
@amy36k not a bad idea! I have other vices to deal with before bread! lol
@esophoenix do you have a humidifier? My poor boys (oldest especially) have eczema SO bad. Lotion them constantly & nothing helps.
@esophoenix the climate is a lot more dry, I bet! Probably didn't change as much as was set off. Moving so far will do that to you!
@deb_wolfe I always go with way early over way late too. Can't stand being late!
@esophoenix har har ! I have similar problems. Lotion lotion lotion. It sounds like you have as many skin problems as my kids. :( :(
My coffee is too hot to drink.  I want to gobble it down!

@vsafterbedtime just reread the tweets. Sorry; thought you were saying histogram was too difficult to use, like grey cards. lol
@vsafterbedtime it's definitely more beneficial in a studio where you control lighting and there are no changes. Not practical for a lot.
@vsafterbedtime it's easy to use histogram at the time of capture. just push a button on the back of your camera. grey card is much harder.
@softasylum Yeah - the link in that tweet is pretty good.  This one is also a good link for histograms: http://dwoe.us/imD5Dn
@vsafterbedtime histogram can help in any situation and is easy to learn. Grey card is only sometimes beneficial
@vsafterbedtime if you shoot Raw, you don't need to worry about image degradation in color editing.
@vsafterbedtime I don't think the grey card compares well. It's easy enough (especially w/eyedropper) to color balance in editing

@alwaysnwonder I can only tolerate hot coffee in the morning.
@alwaysnwonder medium. I don't think it's the coffee. I use creamer in hot coffee, but hate that in iced. Milk/sweetener sucks too.
@alwaysnwonder When I've tried to make iced coffee in the past, I do double brew.  Still just doesn't taste right to me.
@greenearthbazar thanks!!
@smldada those are the biggies.  Comb or finger-comb wet only, NEVER EVER dry comb or brush.

@soapendipity I understand why you wouldn't want to give a stranger access, so I understand if you're uncomfortable with that!
@soapendipity If not, I can take a look into your admin if you want to see if I can find it and fix it. Should only take a few minutes.
@soapendipity If you know where your stylesheet is, look for wrap2 to see if there's any padding or margins set (decrease them if so).
100 of 300 downloaded.  The only drawback to Raw files are their size and the amount of time it takes to transfer them!
BTW, I got a thorn in my finger trying to take a picture of a rose for you guys. I hope you appreciate it.
@soapendipity it's also possible the width needs to be a little bigger.  If you want, I can take a quick look for you and try to change.
Downloading 300 pictures from the weekend.  Hopefully they turned out well SOOC so I don't need to edit them much!
@soapendipity Looks like wrap2 (maybe one of the other classes) needs new padding or margins.
@soapendipity I wouldn't remove anything from the HTML, but would change the stylesheet. Do you know where it is? #SITS31DBBB

@eileenludwig I had to fill out an application and then receive an invite code. Scribd wasn't involved in my set up at all. very weird.
@eileenludwig That's weird. Scoop.It is in beta testing, invite only right now. You can't just sign up for an account.
I hate flies! They keep getting in through the back door.
@eileenludwig yeah, that's Scoop.It.  Completely different than Scribd. :)
@eileenludwig No. I have two papers, one is with Paper.li, the other is Scoop.It.  Neither use Scribd.  I don't use Scribd at all.
@eileenludwig not sure. I don't use Scribd either. Think I connected through Facebook once!

@wibblefish If I was coding a site for my friends, I wouldn't spend much time debugging IE oddities. It can't even handle valid code.
@wibblefish Depends on your audience. It's bad for corporations for sure. I don't actually know anyone personally who uses IE...
@wibblefish Most experienced internet users abandoned it long ago. Sorry for all the replies. :( I passionately dislike IE, obviously. :D
@wibblefish It's still the biggest single browser. Only because it comes pre-installed in Windows and ppl don't know better.
@wibblefish I didn't know you were a Microsoft fanboy. :) According to wikipedia, IE accounts for less than half of all users.
@wibblefish It's just a terrible thing for the internet overall. I wish everyone would abandon it.
@wibblefish It's almost guaranteed if you don't have a separate stylesheet for IE, the site is going to look like crap/not function.
@wibblefish Companies/bigger sites can pay the extra money to get a completely different IE-friendly design to load.
@wibblefish I run into the problem CONSTANTLY with IE 8, but I visit a lot of blogs.
@wibblefish Yes, but when Firefox, Chrome and Safari can all render the code pretty, it's IE's shortcoming, not the designer's.
@_littlemisskate Welcome out of the dark ugly pit that is IE!

@wibblefish The browser on my WebOS smart phone is more reliable than any version of IE.
@wibblefish IE-everything sucks. I'm using the latest version and it won't load half of the pages around the internet.
Every time I open  up IE to perform a test I'm baffled that people still use it. It barely functions as a browser.
@babybabylemon definitely a personal preference. I know lots of bloggers who close comments. Sounds like it might be a good idea for you!
@babybabylemon my content isn't usually time-sensitive though so I'd lose a lot of valuable comments by closing them on old entries.
@babybabylemon if I notice I'm getting a lot of spam on a particular entry, I might close comments, but it doesn't happen a lot.
@babybabylemon curious why you're worried about spam on old entries then? Spam deletes itself after 30 days.
@babybabylemon I can't tell. Are you using Wordpress? Do you have a spam problem even with Akismet?
I don't, but I use Wordpress and Akismet. Spam isn't an issue. RT @babybabylemon: Does anyone close comments on old posts to keep spam down?
