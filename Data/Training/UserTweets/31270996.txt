and it just sucks letting one of your biggest dreams slide right through your fingers and there is nothing you can do about it
Greg tells me that it's not my fault (can't foresee a sprain) but when you feel this low you think about how it could have been different
but that day I was so preoccupied. so much on my mind. work, training, this, that. and then boom.
the worst part is that this injury happened when my mind was in 1000 different places. normally I don't think about anything when I run
there's a dent on the ridge of a bone on top of my foot and there's a faint line (possible fracture) where it shouldn't be. not a good sign.
that's how I felt when my ortho goes, "I can't tell you whether or not your foot is broken."

That's why I tell people to get Garmin activity trackers over anyone else.
All companies should take after @Garmin. I am unbelievably impressed.
Rather than giving me the original watch and probably having the problem again, I get the upgraded version.
For free too, because the CS rep said this has been a reported problem. Now that is customer service.
Not only are they replacing my band, but they are UPGRADING me to the new Vivosmart HR!
The display started fading, but I loved it too much to let it go. I gave in today and called customer service for a replacement.
I've heard nothing but AMAZING things about @Garmin's customer service. I have the original Vivosmart and LOVE IT.

Okay, rant over.
For example the treadmill today told me I burned 750 calories on a 5 mile run. I only burnt 450.
You can set it yourself in the settings, but you may be burning less or more depending on your body.
If you read the disclaimer on exercise machines, the calorie calculator is usually for a 150 pound male.
I am not a fan of heart rate watches because they are usually wrong. Go read the lawsuits against Fitbit right now.
Get the heart rate monitor strap, that's the most accurate. Or dish out money for an optical HR watch.
Calories burnt on most exercise machines are wrong by up to 50%. That's why you wear heart rate monitors people.

don't make fun of people that don't fit the gym stereotype. WE ALL START SOMEWHERE.
someone is wearing makeup? I do that too! sometimes after class or work, I just don't have the time to take it off!
7) stop making fun of people at the gym! I was a New Years person, 5 years and 50 pounds later I stuck with it.
6) you don't need to buy expensive gym clothes to workout. I personally think the essential is good footwear, especially for running.
@TattedWifeLife_ I just find the motion so incredibly tedious haha. but damn, throw some resistance on and you can get a great workout.
@TattedWifeLife_ I agree! I use it to cross train when I'm injured, but it's not the same exercise as actual running which people confuse
5) you don't like lifting? that's fine! no one should force you into it to lose weight or to get muscle, or whatever!
4) stop knocking people who do cardio. everyone has their own likes. I clearly enjoy hours of swimming, biking, and running.
3) STOP GIVING CARBS A BAD REP. there are good carbs and bad carbs, choose wisely.
2) if you do a tea or juice detox, you WILL gain every pound back you lost and probably more. you body will go into shock when you eat again
1) an elliptical is NOT running, don't count that as "miles ran". an elliptical holds your body up, you don't know that in running lol

THAT'S THE TEAM I LOVE TO HATE BC OF HEART ATTACKS BUT I LOVE THEM ANYWAYS!
YESSSS CARDIAC CUSE!
I ran a mile and my ankle is currently on fire.
half-marathon #5 next weekend and I think I'm battling tendonitis. Geez.
COME ON SYRACUSE COME ON
I'm so excited for this summer, especially for this job! I cannot wait to broaden my horizons with a new population.
Anyways, I'M OFFICIALLY MOVING TO VIRGINIA IN MAY! WITH A JOB! AHHHH! I wish Greg wasn't deployed so I could just call with the news.
Lesson of the story: express your love of penguins to your future employer. Or just be honest, that works too!
Less than 24 hours I get a phone call. They wanted to offer me a position right away!
At the end of the conversation they tell me I won't hear back until mid-April. That's no big, I figured.
I was mortified once I realized what I said, but both the recreation therapists started laughing, so I figured that was a good start!
Age 22 and here I am letting a potential future employer know about my extreme love for penguins.
"I love them because we both live in cold conditions. I waddle like them to class! Oh and I collect penguin stuffed animals!"
So obviously I'm like uh okay think of an animal that's tough and all I spit out is "I LOVE PENGUINS!"
Alright, story time: I had my phone interview for my summer position yesterday afternoon. 1st question? What animal would you be and why?
Lesson of the day: listen to your father. Don't be like me and screw up your taxes 😂
BOOO Saucony why couldn't you have made a pink Kinvara 7?!
Pink camouflage bike = buying all the pink and camouflage accessories. Just bought new pink sunglasses, now for the shoes &amp; helmet!
@sierrrrax Flyknits destroyed my teammate. Gave him serious knee and IT band injuries because of the lack of support.
@sierrrrax I'm a marathoner/triathlete and I swear by Saucony. Asics is too heavy for most and causes injuries, Nike is crap, UA is eh.
Greg passed his ESWS board, he is officially dual warfare qualified!!!

1 hour of sprints on the bike and core resulted in eating a @lennyandlarrys cookie in about 2 minutes. Oops.

As material and cheesy as this situation may be, I feel like this is my sign. God truly does provide. Trust His timing. It will work out.
Last Sunday when I went to church, my mom kept saying "God will provide". Religion is something I struggle with, especially lately.
This evening that price decrease finally came!
It was a sign from God that it was meant to be. I was putting off buying this bike for weeks, hoping for more money &amp; a price decrease.
I had a massive panic attack running through my building looking for my wallet. Thank you God the bike store took PayPal.
Good news: I bought my dream triathlon bike and I don't have to work at 6AM tomorrow! Bad news: I left my wallet at home.
the next few weeks are going to fly by so fast WEEEE
weekend after, going to PA. next weekend, moving stuff home. final weekend. done with school, Syracuse graduation + wine tour.
this weekend, home for Easter. next weekend, Syracuse half-marathon. following weekend, Ithaca half marathon. next weekend, 10k + 5k

13.1 miles isn't a big deal when realize in a few months you'll have to bike 56 and swim 1.2 before even getting to the half marathon
There's a half marathon this weekend at home and I'm seriously debating doing 3 half marathons in a row.
Leaving home this morning to only come back in about 96 hours 😂
Somebody once told me I look like the kind of girl that drives a Civic. Nope. I drive a 1997 red station wagon. I love every second of it.
Don't get me wrong, I love his G6 and it's super fun but I really love have my big station wagon with room for my bike + triathlon gear
When Greg comes home we're swapping cars, which means I have to drive a speedy little G6 until I move down.

My car problems were the icing in the cake today. Feeling pretty stressed and this sucks so much

Yes I pick-up a lot of shifts. No I will not cover yours.
Can't wait to get off work to get food
@alissa_niad you can ice too even if you're not running! Ice whenever you get pain and are able to ice
@alissa_niad take aleve and aleve only. It's the best from pain and inflammation. Take a dose in the morning and around dinner or so.
@alissa_niad you don't want to risk the tendonitis turning into a tear
@alissa_niad I'd say take some time off. 1-2 weeks. Heat before when you finally run again, ice after. Do some cross training
@alissa_niad I'm thinking tendonitis :( do you ice the pain at all after a run?
@alissa_niad is it sharp and stabbing? Or dull and achy? How often/long are you running?
@alissa_niad does it hurt before, during, after, or all of the above?

No dogs are harmless, regardless of the breed.
Pitballs that are raised in loving homes, trained properly, have discipline and socialization aren't going to act out due to "one thing"

@_leannnicole Amen girl. Master's are SO expensive, it's going to cost me so much.
@_leannnicole and yeah they all require masters and it sucks. I'm applying to masters programs now and it's so stressful...Ugh.
@_leannnicole I was originally gonna do OT! I'm on the speech therapy track now, but I've been working at the VA in the rec therapy program.
@_leannnicole recreation therapy. It's a new form of therapy so there aren't as many jobs yet :/
well there are...but they all require 3-5 years of experience. How am I supposed to do that if no one hires me?

God forbid Greg sees one piece of my hair on the bathroom floor...but when I tell him them to leave the seat up I get yelled at....
I don't mind sharing a bathroom with girls because we get each other. We don't freak out if we see hair or a tampon wrapper.
Greg and his roommates think it's okay for me to share a bathroom with 3 guys. Potentially 4 or 5 depending on the situation.
I lose like half my race schedule cause I no longer will be able to do collegiate triathlons this year...this makes me so sad.

But seriously, stop believing those stupid things will work.
There are no shortcuts! Maintain a good diet and work out. That's seriously it. If nothing's changing, you need to fix your diet or workout.
People are so quick to buy juices, smoothies, teas, etc. Don't waste your money.
Detoxes DON'T WORK. for the love of God, if you drink only liquids for days at a time, you will gain back weight when you eat solid food!
greg just figured out how to use emojis. 🙈
@Navyy__GF I loved mine until it fell out! Such a cute piercing but so annoying to keep the earring in 😒

@Navyy__GF i bought one online from some site but I suggest going to a piercer. The one I bought online was so hard to put in, I couldn't

@_Jessssika i shouldve gone into the store and had her fired. That info has his SS bc he has the credit card there.
@_Jessssika I'm not the jealous type at all and I trust my boyfriend. But seriously, searching his for his private information?
@_Jessssika how disrespectful and creepy can you be?!?!?
@_Jessssika i wanted to go to the store and bitch her out but my boyfriend didn't want the possibility of charges. But seriously...
