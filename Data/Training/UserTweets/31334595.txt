Seriously the worst day of my life:/
@thereadyset: im watching it:D
Yess!:D The ready set on silent library:D
Things are looking up:D
Worst day ever :/
Why do people strive to live a good life? What's the point once it gets good you die anyways.
Im a fucking failure.
Dear lyndsey, please come back. I have so much to tell you. :/
Happy Valentines day to everyone. :D and in some cases single awareness day :p *cough cough* @monkeyface2723 you know i love you:D

Secret #25: I've counted down the days countless times, and your still not back.. I miss you.
Got my fill of dutch bros today. :D Strawberry red bull and a blended anihilator. :D
Sometimes I just don't understand... And it sucks:/
Stupid phone.
Wisdom teeth&gt;.&lt;
No longer will I listen to nonsense, put up with bullshit, or take my life for granted. Embracing everything i'll make my own.
I can't believe you would leave for something like this I put my faith in nothing, for you to walk away
I feel like I'm dying..
It makes me sick to know that my life will be represented by the world we are in now.
We've come too far to let our story end like this and we've come too far to let what we've built fall apart. This makes me want to cry alot.
@alexishay i miss you (: i have LOTS to tell you!
Last night was pretty amazing (:
"And we are slowly becoming two very different people, but I won't give you up without a fight." -@counterpartshc
I'm just glad my boyfriends here, he gives me strength. i love him&lt;3
I guess you can say that this year is getting better...but what else can it do?
Worst fucking new years of my life :/
Why do people I don't even care about know when I'm upset and you, you should know.. I'm not hiding anything. Stop being oblivious.
I wish everything was better..I miss you.
secret #1: I smile all the time so that nobody knows how sad and lonely I am.
whatever.
How am I supposed to feel comfortable in my own house when you threaten me like that.
Fuck this shit. I don't need to be here.
Don't tell me your sorry when you don't know what's going on just because I'm sad doesn't mean it can't be my fault
I need some friend who will tell me when my actions are wrong. Some true friends.
I can't do this on my own.
Just saw someone get a mole pierced..
Leave me alone!
I missed you :)
I'm glad I have some people to talk to. And you, you really understand.
