RT @EvanMathis69: Kobe's wife leaves him and he tears a ligament in his wrist. That joke tells itself.
@kcrotSAN #itdoesnthavetobeungay
I deleted my Facebook today. It felt good. This is my first real tweet. I was hoping it'd be funnier. #underwhelming
@ZachValentin  @D_Brown15 @PaulGallello @MrJClark14 Feels good. Welcome to the team @jugebulat
@sethmeyers21 Tate, Ivory
@MrJClark14 Dallas tonight. If only Tampa wasn't just awful.
@ZachValentin @MrJClark14 @D_Brown15 @PaulGallello I just wish Dave Brown would try harder.
@MrJClark14 I'm taking Atlanta tonight. I'm going to tweet my picks from now on. Go Magnum PI's!
@BFeldmanCBS So that means they will have to recruit 15 less players?
@D_Brown15 @PaulGallello @MrJClark14 @ZachValentin They are called "Hoss House". I bet Tom Selleck eats at Ponderosa.
@PriscoCBS @SI_JimTrotter He's a winner, so he's obviously #1
@dan0smith me sorry :(
@dan0smith You want followers or not?
@dan0smith I will send some porn bots your way!
@PaulGallello YOU NEED TO TWEET! DON'T BE LIKE SARAH JESSICA PARKER!
@MrJClark14 He'll throw people under the bus, but he'll do it with his actions, not his words. He's insulated himself from getting fired.
@MrJClark14 I can't wait to fire Castillo, not bring back Desean, and go 10-6 next year and lose early in the playoffs!
@HighCheese No. It usually takes 10 replays to sink in.
@Jeff_McLane For which team?
@kcrotSAN @D_Brown15 I don't kid. Dave Brown is a menace and he needs to be stopped.
@kcrotSAN Sounds like something @D_Brown15 would enjoy!
@kcrotSAN Sexy
@AbbieGallello Sweet tweets!
@PriscoCBS AP is reporting he is done
@dan0smith C U TMRW!
@dan0smith Sweet tweets, stinkwad!
@PaulGallello You are the worst tweeter in the history of tweets
@D_Brown15 HI DAVE! HOPE U HAD A GR8 THANKSGIVING!!!!!!!!!!!!
@paulgallello Sweet tweet sign up!
@kcrotSAN Happy Thanksgiving to you too, bud!
@HighCheese Surprised odds aren't 1:500. Think they'll lose some money on the yes bets.
@caplannfl Ties against Washington and Seattle? Loss against Miami? Beat NYJ, NYG, NE and Dallas?
@BFeldmanCBS Because he is going to kill himself before trial?
@geoffmosher Not if they are those Cardinals pass rushers. You know. Those guys.
@LesBowen Can't it be a tie??
@kcrotSAN Let me know how it is. #idontmeanthebeancurd
@D_Brown15 @ZachValentin Itz guna b sikkkk
RT @D_Brown15: @davebrinkman @kcrotSAN Tweeting is for the birds....HA, GET IT? Birds tweet also!!!!!!!!
@kcrotSAN @D_Brown15 Threeway tweet!
@kcrotSAN Sweet tweets, Nate!
@SI_PeterKing You two are two of the absolute best.
@darrenrovell Can't fire a "whistle-blower"?
@TDESPN Good enough to win the Super Bowl of spelling?
@ap_smith3 You bet Amy?
@ap_smith3 Bama bc its at home. Low scoring game. What you think?
RT @SteveMartinToGo: It&#39;s hard to write a funny tweet when your dog is holding a gun on you. Yet, that is exactly what is happening.
@keithlaw @bengalbraith Palmer?
RT @ShawnRyanTV: Tonight I went as Tim Tebow for Halloween. Threw eggs at my neighbor's house, accidentally hit my own.
@JimmyRollins11 Eagles 30-24 #jrollscorepredictor
@EricStangel Ocsnowber?
@tpanotchCSN no
@keithlaw Please tell me there aren't people like that. You just made that up to be funny?
@D_Brown15 Your tweets are shallow and pedantic
@RossTuckerNFL Eagles hated? Fearful of Eagles getting on a roll? Don't think the Skins are legit?
@arielhelwani Maynard/Jim Miller rematch?
@MatthewBerryTMR Hernandez over Vernon Davis?
@ap_smith3 Yeah I saw. Not the worst thing in the world. He wasn't healthy and the young guys can play early.
@LesBowen Showed 5 replays of Molina. Showed 0 of Utley sliding into 2nd.
@LesBowen I'm just glad Brenly is gone. Can't get too greedy.
@ap_smith3 Down 1-0 bottom 5. Halladay shaky 1st but unstoppable since. Finally made Carpenter throw last inning.

RT @EricStangel: Don't make mistake I just made. To learn about #Tigers pitcher don't just Google "Fister," make sure to type "Doug Fister"
@ap_smith3 Phils are not playing smart. That Motte throws meatballs first pitch and the Phils do nothing. 0-1. Then they panic.
@Ken_Rosenthal Halladay is so much better than Burnett! You're an idiot! #idontunderstandsarcasm
@ap_smith3 Big Ben has no offensive line.
@ap_smith3 Ha I heard. Spoiling him! Thanks again for watching him! I'm sure Laura will wake up eventually and come over.
@blueclaws 534
RT @sportsguy33: Guys I'd rather have starting Game 163 than Bruce Chen: 1) Pedro Martinez, 2) Denny Galehouse, 3) Kevin Costner, 4) Me.
@darrenrovell I actively seek out Bud Light bottles bearing the Phillies logo
@AlbertBreer Rocking Witten/Finley this year. All about value! Convention is for the mediocre!

@SHVinDC Sweet tweets yo!
@D_Brown15 Tweet-up later?
"@D_Brown15: Just wanted to wish a happy birthday @davebrinkman he is by far one of the coolest guys I know." Thanks bro!
@MatthewBerryTMR Deji Karim gets a bump, right?
@SI_JimTrotter Ray Rice!
@LesBowen Does the Donald Lee release open up a roster spot for Jeff Thomason?
@LesBowen Better than Blue Jays vs Orioles? Appreciate the sarcasm though.
RT @michaelianblack: Connecticut is without power: what are we supposed to do? Have the help wash our clothes by hand? THIS IS BARBARISM!!!
"@ZachValentin: Its mine...all mine. http://t.co/evRi2yr" Sweet pic!
"@D_Brown15: It's crazy hanging out @davebrinkman, what a draft. TOUCHDOWNS" We raised the roof!
@D_Brown15 Live-tweet our draft results?
@LesBowen Definitely meth
@D_Brown15 Sweet softball season. Almost perfect!
@JPosnanski How dare you insult Rivera? What are you? A Lee Smith supporter?
@Philled_In Love me some old Simpsons references. Called someone a prank monkey the other day and they didn't get it.
@magelb Why hasn't he voluntarily joined the Astros yet?? He's selfish!
@D_Brown15 DB2 + tweets = touchdowns!
@DanWetzel Pryor would have been a great target for Clausen.
@LesBowen For Justin Upton?
@Philled_In Nice. I was hoping Beltran for Kolb straight up.
@LesBowen So 50/50 shot?
@KevinMcAlpin That's way too much kayaking for my taste
@ZachValentin Sweet tweets!
@michaelianblack Try Rhode Island
@michaelianblack In heaven, there is a season two of Michael and Michael have issues #inheaven
@HighCheese The Phils should trade Howard and call up Rizzotti. Also, I would rather have a first round pick than Cliff Lee.
@michaelianblack I'll send you my company car. It's a LeBaron.
@LesBowen I wish your common sense arguments didn't contradict my blind faith in Andy Reid
@LesBowen Kiper had him as the top safety available after Moore was drafted
