If your married, or when you GET married, if your spouse has a problem with something LISTEN to them. RESPECT THEIR FEELINGS.
Nobody is promised tomorrow. We only have today. And this is said often, but too often we dont take it serious.. By then its too late.

Every morning when you open your eyes, and breathe that first breath, it's a gift from God. It's a privilege. Don't take it lightly.
When you almost lose your life.. you see everything differently.  And you only wish everyone could see what you see now. But they can't.

moving on.. is the only thing to do.
It was everything we wanted it to be, summer of 19 you and me.
I always knew you'd be the kind of person I wish I had never met.
To be a good friend is very important. Good friends are hard to find and rare. Everyone needs one. Be the kind of friend youd like to have
Love Others. Dont hate. Dont Judge. Forgive &amp; Forget. And live in peace with everyone. Keep a clear concious and a clean heart.
Unconditionally, without reason, and without ever expecting ANYTHING in return. Thats how your supposed to love others.
Im so so tired. Lacey stayed the night with me, and I barely got any sleep... When you get older- sleep becomes so important :/ lol

SoO much to do today. Feelin the stress already.. Lord help me.
Never trust a person who openly admits that they cannot even trust their own self.
There's nothing I hate more than seeing someone I love hurting.. :(
I wanna thank God today for an answered prayer!! Ive been praying for days, sowed a seed and God answered a prayer for me!! So grateful!!
You brought me this far, so why would I question You now? You have provided, so why would I start to doubt?
I praise God for everything ive ever been through. I wouldnt trade a second of it for anything. Because God is able to use me to help others
The best way to have compassion for others- is to have *experience*. You have to hurt and be comforted.. so that you too can comfort others.
Not looking forward to packing.. but I am looking forward to leaving..
Bones sinking like stones, all that we fall for... Homes places we've grown, all of us are done for.
You can do everything right, and someone will still do you wrong.

These past few years have been some of the hardest times of my life. And not once did God leave me or let me down..
Just laying here thinking about how far God has brought me.. Im so grateful.. I could have never made it through this life without God.
I am most definitely not the best at what I do.. but I do my best and work with what ive got and that's all that really matters.
Sure wish I could see Grandpa today.. Its just one of them kinda days..
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
I love the way it feels when I pull off my fake eye lashes. A hint of pain and a lil fear.. so strangely pleasurable.
All this stupid weather does is bring back every memory ive ever tried to forget... I hate the cold :(
Listening to a man on TBN talk about his experience in hell.. wow
The answer to my question earlier is-  probably because they never loved you in the first place!!!!!
@Michael_Lotsin oh yeah great answer.. NOT
How can someone love you one day and the next they don't lol.... doesn't make sense.
RT @LovLikeJesus: When things aren't working out as you wish, be patient. Stop trying to move ahead of God. His timing is perfect.

Dear Ex Boyfriend. I understand everything now....
Id give up the next ten years of my life, to spend just a little more time with Grandpa.
My life has been a poor attempt, To imitate the man... I'm just a living legacy, to the leader of the band...
Strong is my ONLY CHOICE.
I feel.. so drained. Mentally, physically, and spiritually.
Ive been second best my entire life.  I want to be someones one and only.
I have to be true to my heart.
Had sooOo much fun today... :) with lacey &amp; @Wells_Pachie http://t.co/xvOCT1LUOA
Don't get mad when someone else starts to appreciate what you took for granted..
At the end of the day.. there's only you.. and God..
Sometimes I wish God hadnt given me such a big, compassionate, heart. Its so fragile, easily touched, easily broken.. &lt;/3
The truth is... I gave my heart away a long time ago, my whole heart... and I never really got it back.
I need to start making some money.. the holidays are coming up and this girl needs a dolla.....  forreal #money #broke lol
No more candy corn for me.

Sometimes love is not enough.....
If HE cant respect GOD/The Holy Spirit, he will never respect YOU... &amp; that is a DEAL-BREAKER.
If HE cant go to CHURCH, but he can meet me after.... Thats a DEAL-BREAKER.
If HE cant show up at Church on a Sunday... ITS A DEAL-BREAKER.
If HE doesnt LOVE GOD as much as I do, or more than I do... Its a DEAL-BREAKER..
Expect NOTHING from NOBODY and you'll never be DISAPPOINTED or LET DOWN.

Dont you ever just get tired of the same old stupid thing, over and over again? Routine is so boring. I need something new in my life.
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.. for me it happens all the time.
The older I get, the earlier I go to bed.. lol boy has things changed..
No worries, no stress, no heartache. And I go to bed when I want, I dont have to wait for a phone call.. ;) lol #singlelife #foreveralone

@SarahBear921 thanks girl

God doesn't care how many scriptures you can memorize or quote. Even the devil knows the word of God. He wants you to LIVE IT daily!
How can you claim to be a christian yet you are nothing like Jesus? *Christian* means to be LIKE CHRIST. Are you living like Jesus? Think.
You cannot love God and be a lover of this world and the things in it. Choose one, God or this earth. Soon the earth will pass away...
How can you say YOU LOVE GOD yet you dont follow his commandments or his ways? (Read matthew 5:8) *Your heart is far from him.*
Im turning my phone off for a bit. If yall got an emergency call 911 or call on Jesus. My anxiety is flaring up worse than ever. Pray 4 me.
Every day, at the exact same time, I have anxiety and trouble breathing. What could this be from?? #anxiety #panic #asthma

Just lettin everyone know- I changed my phone #. I am no longer accepting calls/texts! I was getting overwhelmed! I hope yall understand.
The only thing to fear.... is fear itsself.
Your memory haunts me.
RT @Sleep2Dream8: @LadyCookieLuck He's brought you this far to let someone destroy what He has repaired.
RT @SarahBear921: @LadyCookieLuck take it from me, you are NOT a big girl. I wish I could look like you. Youre gorgeous, and not anywhere c‚Ä¶
The devil uses PEOPLE to destroy me. And they can destroy me faster then the devil himsself can. Aint that somethin?
Somebody done opened up the door for the devil.. and he's happily running around, doing his thang!
"I will love others [just] as He has loved me. John 15:12""
