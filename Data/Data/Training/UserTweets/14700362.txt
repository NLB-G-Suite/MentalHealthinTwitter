@BretMueller @dcjames5 @xOGCamox @nflguy49 @ProFootballTalk Yup. This is also what I tell people in Cleveland when… https://t.co/Ctrh4zr436
@MattGelb damn I really miss the Phils being able to get under his skin so easily. Like clockwork.
@BillSimmons Clippers have no marbles.
@joethomas73 Finally, a sensible take.
@AdamSchefter And it was never even close to being a game....
@KyleNeubeck did Stein mention of they are repairing it or removing it?
@MalcolmJenkins @NFL @Kaepernick7 in just think he's like Jay Cutler. Talented, though very flawed, expects to "compete" for a starting job.
@rich_hofmann @ZachLowe_NBA just draft the player than trade him.
If you really want to grab people's attention at a public speaking event, start off by calling a member of the audience a racial slur.
@mcguig24 @BillSimmons Plus, 76ers got totally lucky that Jahlil Okafor couldn't play in the 2nd half!
@BobCooney76 the 76ers medical team is on it, no need to worry folks
Rachel Maddow is being as dramatic as Walter Cronkite announcing JFK's death.
@alexandraamey damn. Well, never give up. They def release tickets in waves, not all at once.
@alexandraamey You gotta be persistent &amp; not give up. I grabbed a great pair, but it took me 20 minutes.
@alexandraamey tickets don't sell out in 2 seconds.TM doesn't release all the tickets at once. System would crash with everyone checking out
@Kisses4sweetB @AmericanExpress For Amex one tomorrow, just choose "Amex presale" in drop down menu at 10. Then pay with your card.
@Kisses4sweetB @AmericanExpress are you talking about the one today? That was a code you had to sign up for on Ed's website.
@Jeff_McLane Can you explain to what the point is of releasing him &amp; signing Foles to a cap strapped team?
@Kisses4sweetB @AmericanExpress no code, just use your card
@Tim_McManus @caplannfl that can't be right, how would that be beneficial to the team at all?
@motherofgrm @rich_hofmann ha! Whole foundation of that team are bad defenders. It'll be a good pick no matter what.
@rich_hofmann talented, but he's honestly dumb as hell.
@tjbey2000 @motherofgrm @rich_hofmann yeah maybe a bit. I just think they won't make much progress until they learn how to get stops.
@motherofgrm @rich_hofmann Man, I'd much rather get the pick this year, but it's not like they are gonna start playing D next year either.
@rich_hofmann If these Sixers hang 115 on them like every other team, he just might have to.
@PappaJoegio they ain't gonna get anything for half year of him. Maybe one of these years Pels will find a way to get unstuck.
@PappaJoegio but I guess you are actually still kinda right. Doesn't make it any less sad now that he was that excited &amp; they are still shit
@PappaJoegio It's weird that getting a player  who isn't going to help your franchise at all is your crowning jewel defining moment
@shwamusic the greatest minds of the world cloned, but have become massive underachievers
@shwamusic just looked it up. Just set it in community college.
@shwamusic never heard of it. I'm sure you can tweak the concept and make it better
@shwamusic Major Dad?
@PappaJoegio @BillSimmons "greatest night in franchise history!" Haha.
@PappaJoegio @BillSimmons you are so angry Jose. Pels suck and nobody wanted to give up anything for Cousins anyway. No value there.
@BillSimmons I feel sorry for the Pels fan that was on the ringer live the night that trade went down. "Best night in Pels history!"
@Jeff_McLane What was the movie question?
@EliotShorrParks I'd go Alshon, but if Pryor can prove it again, I'd prob change my mind
@Edwerderespn Not trolling, just genuinely curious, do coaches every say to you "this guy we just signed, his work ethic is terrible?"
@DannyTac15 @ProFootballTalk Also, can you imagine if Romo winds up in Denver now?
@DannyTac15 yeah but there is a salary floor. They literally have to figure out a way to spend money to get to it, regardless.
@DannyTac15 @ProFootballTalk yeah Browns need to draft better. But they literally lose nothing with this trade.
@DannyTac15 @ProFootballTalk oh wait man you thought Clev traded the 2nd Rd pick for Osweiler???
@DannyTac15 @ProFootballTalk Of course he is garbage, but Clev is gonna suck with or without him this year. And 2nd Rd picks are no joke
@DannyTac15 @ProFootballTalk how?
@mbahlman @robertmays yeah you gotta get to the cap floor anyway. Why not get an asset for it?
@AdamSchefter this is actually smart by the Browns. Teams do this in basketball all the time
@mharrisCSN in reference to Angelo yelling Britt is "just a guy!". And you can hear it in your voice, you're like "just stop, dude".
@mharrisCSN I just noticed how you call hosts out on their troll jobs when they are just trying to get their audience worked up. Kudos.
@Ike58Reese Twitter spats with your teammates certainly doesn't help their cause!
At this point, if I'm a kid with a parent in the military, if I go to a sporting event, I'm EXPECTING my parent to pop out of a box.
@BillSimmons I heard that it was 2 hrs 45 mins. That movie is gonna suck some serious dick.
@EliotShorrParks Jared Allen in 08 may have been only good one.
@EliotShorrParks Revis, Bradford, Richard Seymour
@EliotShorrParks I've actually been trying to think of when trading a Top 20 pick for a player ended up working out for that team?
@EliotShorrParks yeah, cost control is certainly appealing of all these draft picks though
@tonydholden @westmontwarrior @RapSheet I hear ya. Pats always trying to swindle people though. If Saints somehow get mid 1st, God Bless em.
@tonydholden @westmontwarrior @RapSheet I understand what the Saints want. I'm not sure what you don't get about "a swap of picks"?
@tonydholden @westmontwarrior @RapSheet I did. Ian was adding information not in the article.
@tonydholden @westmontwarrior @RapSheet It's a confusing insinuation, but I gather it was 32nd pick for Cooks &amp; Saints 2nd round pick.
@J_Dub23_1 @JHolasHoops I think he's like a PG version of JR Smith. Lots of highs, lots of lows. Not a great understanding of the game.
RT @TheAVClub: A “cannabis gym” is opening in San Francisco  https://t.co/RtCGEesFfU https://t.co/u69SUXTvGq
This old episode of Law &amp; Order I'm watching features both Samuel L. Jackson &amp; Phillip Seymour Hoffman in supporting roles. Life is amazing.
@jpetersen Nice!
@AndyGlockner @KyleNeubeck the medical staff assures you that it's not the meniscus.
@KyleNeubeck also a 10 week injury that somehow became a 30 week one.
@DerekBodnerNBA Yeah, I would like to have a medical staff that kinda knows what they're doing, though....
@rich_hofmann I don't know if he is literally lying all the time or the medical staff is that bad.
@JakePavorsky woah, I was right. They really need a whole new medical staff at this point
@JakePavorsky we are going to find out the meniscus was torn more than initially thought, then he'll praise "top notch" medical staff.
@xxmikelinexx @NBAGuruGray If you wanna say they shouldn't have drafted BPA all the time &amp; created a logjam, then I think that's fair.
@xxmikelinexx @NBAGuruGray Me? I just said you were wrong to bat for MCW. I think you realize devoting big $$$ to backup isn't realistic
@xxmikelinexx @NBAGuruGray I don't think that's true at all. Noel kept improving. Okafor was never asked to play D, &amp; that's crippled him.
@NBAGuruGray @xxmikelinexx Yeah, it's not even a question, that trade was a heist &amp; Stauskas was just a sweetner w/ upside.
@jpetersen @redbox It was supposed to come out on redbox next week, but disappeared from their site a couple days ago.
@NBAGuruGray @xxmikelinexx It's possible. There is a lot to knock 76ers for, but going to bat for MCW is just the misguided.
@xxmikelinexx @NBAGuruGray If you are gonna argue that the Sixers are poorly run I won't argue, but MCW friggin' sucks man. Can't shoot.
@Edwerderespn Is there ever scenario in which "trade player A in this scenario for player b in this other scenario" ISN'T total speculation?
@shwamusic Damn man, I got 245. You are the master.
@rich_hofmann My guess is we find out meniscus tear "worse than initially thought" followed by "our training staff is top notch".
@JeffPassan not really the point. what a fuck up.

@phillysport @bobfordsports I'll give Bob credit, this wasn't as bad as Bob Brookover's sign Rajon Rondo article last summer
@SI_PeterKing Moonlight is a lot better than Fences
@BillSimmons Has Al Horford been on Mars the last month?
@BillSimmons @ringer you like what the Celtics didn't do, and trash everybody else? These columns write themselves!
"You are a snake. What kind of snake are you? A garden snake, or a cobra? -probably something a shitty motivational speaker would say.
@JakeLFischer If he learns how to rebound &amp; block shots then I could totally maybe see him being a starter in this league.
@KyleNeubeck The Man of Action, indeed!
@KyleNeubeck Ask about transparency and the ridiculous headline of getting an unattainable 1st round pick for NN.
@McGuff50 @KyleNeubeck @Sixers that's what I hate about this. On such a big day, he spent time negotiating this simply for "PR" purposes.
@Sixers @JusAnderson1 @andrewbogut "First Round Pick". C'mon @Sixers that's pathetic and misleading to lead with that
@EliotShorrParks I totally agree, but it is his fault, or maybe even his coaches in HS &amp; College, that no teams want his skill set.
@daldridgetnt God Bless you David, but I think you are the only one not surprised....
@KyleNeubeck I honestly hope he hears this stuff &amp; gets the message, for the sake of his career.
@hoopscritic @MarkDeeksNBA I think you make a good point here, though. I don't think ANYBODY saw Jahlil being this useless in NBA in 2015.
@BillSimmons H'e right, but Lombardi also doesn't understand how the lottery works, so.....
@hoopscritic don't know if it's true, but this is the first positive comment I've seen on the trade for Colangelo's side.
@rich_hofmann and when he talks to the media, he's just gonna blame it on the cards he's been dealt.
@rich_hofmann Just hold him and see if you wanna match a RFA if that's all you get. Colangelo is so dumb it's unreal.
@KevinOConnorNBA He's so friggin' dumb. His arrogance like "Hinkie was a jr. league, now I'm a REAL GM" when he came in is infuriating.
If you ever wanna know why the fans in Philadelphia have no respect for Bryan Colangelo, this is it. https://t.co/ROYKqTRKyx
@DerekBodnerNBA Jesus what the hell was Colangelo thinking? Just garbage. I'd much rather see if I want to match an offer sheet.
@Josabarman96 @BillSimmons Ingram is the key, yeah. He'd have to be in any deal with another player &amp; that 1st, at minimum.
@bayphish @BillSimmons I mean, most of the time, #1 loss team doesn't win the lottery, if that's your point.
@BillSimmons I love people responding like "Hey, they got Houstons pick!", like D'angelo &amp; pick #27 gets you Paul George.
@bayphish @BillSimmons Sixers were 2nd worst team that year
@EliotShorrParks @njdotcom I dunno. If you could get an extension agreement sure, but that dude LOVES LA.
@WojVerticalNBA @TheVertical @YahooSports I think this is the guy Philly would flip their assets for.
@jga41agher @ringer that 2019 pick for the Sixers looks better every day.
@mlombardiNFL Do you know about the lottery?
@andy_schreiber @ESPNSteinLine It's easy to be self righteous about "tanking" when no one on your team can play defense.
@DerekBodnerNBA intentional shot at Colangelo?
@BillSimmons there is really no reason for Bulls to trade him now, though. Might as well wait till off season when you know where picks land
@DerekBodnerNBA Exactly. Post Finals run, it was "throw shit at the wall &amp; see what sticks". I don't see how people prefer that.
@edgrcinco @ZachLowe_NBA In hindsight, yeah. But everyone thought Brooklyn was gonna be the new free agent destination at the time.
@Michael_Levin Colangelo is like David Lee Roth circa 1996 who think he's still hot shit &amp; doesn't realize the game passed him bye
@DerekBodnerNBA I think it worked out for the 76ers, but honestly, what was Colangelo thinking not taking this deal, even lottery protected?
@SeanDeveney I think the protection on the pick would've been a lot higher, though. Like full lottery protection someone tweeted last week.
@SeanDeveney yeah but what was the pick protection? A lot more protection than top 3, I imagine.
@ramonashelburne kind of actually worked out better for the Sixers too, given the pick swap &amp; 2019 Kings pick they have
@DerekBodnerNBA That's gotta be the worst roster in the NBA now.
@aaronbruski Wow, you were actually kind of right on this one.
@rich_hofmann They win, what, two games rest of the year?
@BillSimmons @Riley_McAtee Ainge baby, wants to be buried with those "assets"
@aaronbruski Jesus, that was the "godfather" offer?
@rich_hofmann @kings that would be so Kings though, to hold off on trading Cousins for years, then doing it for a Buddy Heild led package.
@HoopsRumors like, 10 teams could better that offer in a heartbeat
@shepardwong @KyleNeubeck exactly. Plus, the Kings are dumber than shit if the best they can do is Heild &amp; some #1's.
@WojVerticalNBA @TheVertical like 8 teams should be able to beat a Pels package easily
@Matt_Winkelman Chris Carpenter
@JakePavorsky @Liberty_Ballers the sad thing is, this is the stuff Colangelo is supposed to be good at.
@DerekBodnerNBA this is the stuff Colangelo is supposed to be good at.
@NicoleScarrow they speculate as to what tickets they can get and liat. They don't actually have the tickets yet.
@BillSimmons no superstars have been traded in years.
@matt_mullin  I'm late to the discussion, but after this meniscus thing this weekend, I told a friend he's Hinkie w/o the creative trades.
@ladygaga I'm literally looking at tickets available for Tacoma right now
@BobCooney76 If a trade doesn't happen by this point, they should realize Colangelo just isn't the guy.
This is the point where Beyonce starts going off the deep end, isn't it?

@LyleMSpencer @JonHeyman huh?
@JonHeyman I actually think Bayless is paid appropriately. He's paid to troll, and people listen and get up in arms.
RT @rich_hofmann: If the Eagles ever lost like that, I would be completely off the grid for two months minimum.

@billsdaman88 @jonjohnsonwip He either hurt his knee again on FRI, or someone is interested in Jah, &amp; wants them to demonstrate Jah's health
@jonjohnsonwip I really like Brett but don't treat the fans like they are morons. Would make no sense to play him FRI then sit 4 week.
@BobCooney76 what were they thinking letting him play Friday then?
@jon_bois @jonahkeri @aubrey_huff I don't get it. Did he think all those fans who had the time to go to day games were just losers?
@dsjunior_11 @aquil_stephens No argument there, but point was, dynamics of bone bruise is certainly a bit different than a regular bruise
@aquil_stephens @dsjunior_11 It's a bit odd considering how conservative they are with him. Though I'm sure they had their reasons.
@aquil_stephens @dsjunior_11 I'm no expert, but I know it can kind of clot abnormally, break off bone, then creat a floating body in knee
@dsjunior_11 @aquil_stephens I don't think it's quite like that. I remember when Bynum had them, they talked at length why he had to sit.
Against all odds, I'm "all in" on La La Land.
@JoelEmbiid He feels threatened by any other good big man, for some reason.
@NYzFinest11 ok man
@NYzFinest11 Oh I get it. If he didn't think Carmelo &amp; the quick fix Knicks would get a team full of chuckers, shame on him.
@BillSimmons In all fairness, KP seemed to WANT to go to NY during the draft.....
@MyCokeRewards the problem with the video you keep sending everybody to is that it doesn't actually tell you anything, other than "new".
@BillSimmons Sometimes I think Ainge wants to be buried with all his "assets".
@DerekBodnerNBA It seemed like just yesterday Luke Walton was a genius.
@ProFootballTalk What did he do two years ago?
@AdamSchefter yeah, this wasn't the best season.
@TCVblog @hoopscritic knee contusion
@ESPNSteinLine doesn't the excess money just get distributed to current players if team doesn't meet salary floor?
@u2songs Trying to do a cross country trip &amp; see NY2, CH2, &amp; LA2. For 1st day of sales, says you can buy up to 6. Is that per show or total?
@DerekBodnerNBA There has to be some guys who haven't even seen him play yet.
@IBLEEDGREEN_09 Well, it should be a concern.
@IBLEEDGREEN_09 being bench players on a good team w/ guys playing big minutes in front of them. That's the concern with Ainge holding picks
@IBLEEDGREEN_09 People saying these recent Celtics pics stink are ridiculous, but I do think it's fair to question how they'll develop...
@TicketCrusader You wouldn't happen to have the venue presale for U2 at the Rose Bowl today, would you?
@WojVerticalNBA announcing to everyone you aren't going to resign makes it tough on him. What's SAC incentive to let him play though rust?
@BillSimmons but Al Horford?!?!?!!?
I'm guessing the dude at my gym in the Castlevania t-shirt and the pajama pants isn't a hardcore "gym rat".
@Michael_Levin too many back to backs, but it's officially fun.
@Boston__Sucks @CGillespie88 Yeah, me too. It's amazing to me to listen to him gush over Embiid like a school girl now
@CGillespie88 @Boston__Sucks All Charry did 4 2 years was sulk about how they should've taken Smart or Gordon, &amp; Saric would never come over
@CGillespie88 @Boston__Sucks Does anyone ever call in &amp; call him on his shit? Still took guts to pick Embiid.
@PhillySports_4 @PhillyFanRuns I think his point was that the Jrue trade literally started the process.
@WindhorstESPN now if we can get a sex scandal going for "Disney on Ice" we'll really be good to go.
@EliotShorrParks Which player is the least nice to reporters, children, &amp; old people?

@MetromileHelp Gotcha. It's a lot to take in. I could sign up, and if I decide after a month that it's not for me, I can just pay for 1st...
@Lue888 @Metromile With comprehensive, I can' see a reason to deny. You gave me a lot to think about, thank you and good luck.
@Lue888 @Metromile As long as you had comprehensive, of course.
@Lue888 @Metromile  Did they tell you if that was their personal policy or some state law? I'm no agent, but I would think it'd be covered.
@Lue888 @Metromile That sucks man, sorry to hear. Thanks for responding.
@Lue888 @Metromile Hey, I was thinking of signing up with them. Do you mind if I ask why they denied your claim?
@BasketBlog_ @Al_Iannazzone that's actually a really good point. He's back with the team less than 24 hours later after "emergency"?
@MgoCJ @WindhorstESPN it sounded better than I posted on myspace.
@WindhorstESPN I tweeted that about the Texans right after Vince Young won the National Championship. I still haven't lived it down.
@mharrisCSN They don't feel "boxed in" anymore. Feels like all teams waiting for a star to be available via trade have been waiting a while
@mharrisCSN I'd do it in a heartbeat. With the cap as high as it is now, I just don't think teams trade really good players anymore.
@BillSimmons I feel like the cap is so high now, you'll never see anyone player of note traded. Teams don't feel boxed in anymore.
I miss the days when a friend would accuse another of "being chicken" &amp; would follow it up with an obnoxious clucking sound. Simpler Times.
@BillSimmons Danny's shit platter probably not appealing to Sixers.

@moviesontherox @Jeff_McLane It's a courtesy to let someone interview for a promotion, not mandatory.
@BobCooney76 I'd like to see them reward him with minutes instead of just handing them to Jahlil.
@Tim_McManus That would have been a great month.
Is the "twist" in the movie Split is that the main guy doesn't really have a multiple personality disorder &amp; is just fucking with them?

@DHuddy41 Congrats on your new deal. You seem like a good dude. Merry Christmas to you &amp; your family.
@EliotShorrParks he's right, but gosh, if all hew gonna do is sign Bayless and draft the slam dunk at #1, then why is he here?
@caplannfl I thought the "man of action" was brought here to shape the team into something.
@jayson041880 Having an inventory of one position is not a problem if you have talent. Problem is Jah sucks, NN is always injured &amp; FA.
@jayson041880 yeah, I agree, but they'll pay because of need, regardless of an abundance of inventory,
@jayson041880 No one wants these players because of their warts, not that you have a plethora of big men.
@jayson041880 You aren't getting anything for NN, because of FA &amp; he's sulking &amp; no 1 wants a center who doesn't play D. No interest in Jah.
@jayson041880 @DerekBodnerNBA It all comes down to talent. You'd get soemthing for Embiid, because he's obviously extremely good.
@jayson041880 @DerekBodnerNBA I definitely agree there. Everyone sniping at each other in press is a bad team scenario
@jayson041880 @DerekBodnerNBA I think best case right now, you get GSW or Cavs late #1 for NN. Best case.
@jayson041880 @DerekBodnerNBA Teams just don't need bigs right now. It's not that 76ers have a plethora, the market has a plethora
@jayson041880 @DerekBodnerNBA Guys like Monroe &amp; Faried on the block, &amp; they can't be given away. Bogut will also be available.
@jayson041880 @DerekBodnerNBA I don't think that matters as much as there are no teams that desperately need centers.
@ProFootballTalk whenever he talks, you can just tell he's such a horse's ass.
@DerekBodnerNBA I'm still amazed there are season ticket holders who are surprised when the team isn't forthright
This employee at Barnes &amp; Noble is wearing holiday themed thigh high stockings &amp; it's the most sultry thing I've ever seen in retail.

@JakePavorsky The whining to the press? Or practice habits and such?
Don't know how hazing stuck around so long in MLB, yet again, I don't understand why every pitcher has a goatee that wasn't cool since 2002
@AmazonHelp I dunno, just left a sour taste in my mouth. Would a thank you been too much too ask? Instead of threat to charge?
@AmazonHelp setting up label and such. Then email with label says to send back in "30 days or else " type message.
@AmazonHelp just reported an extra item shipped to me. No thanks for being honest or anything, in fact I'm saying thanks to CSR for....
Don't contact @amazon @AmazonHelp when mistakenly sent extra item. Never got a thank you, just threat to charge if not sent back in 30 days.
@CNN Kanye doesn't look all there at all.
@Jeff_McLane The insinuation is that he's a hypochondriac ?
@DerekBodnerNBA I think it was a catch.
@JonHeyman Dude, we get it, MLB is better than NFL.....
@ZBerm Maybe he should reconsider his pre game ritual of eating 3lbs clams from the local corner store before each game.
@EliotShorrParks He has the immune system of an 80 year old woman
@MattGelb I can't believe all these people who want them to sign decent $$ FA's just so they can win 80 games this year.
@ESPNFantasy Nope, just Alex Smith &amp; Spencer Ware.
@ProFootballTalk I'm also a fan of "just saying"
@SCooley1023 @Joelsherman1 no
@JonHeyman Damn, that is a big time prospect for a player who might be in sharp decline.
@CNN Fat shaming stinks, but asking a professional athlete to maintain a certain figure isn't out of line.
@pitchfork @SturgillSimpson This is the vogue thing now. Defer to a critical darling after win or nominee for instant cred.
@Joelsherman1 Feels like McCutchen is washed up. Legs are gone.
@ProFootballTalk Yeah, bad teams do shit like that.
@EliotShorrParks Just as long as he loves on them....
.@NFL Is every NFL stadium contracted to play "Welcome to the Jungle" right before kickoff?
@BillSimmons Gotta love those games when Al Horford takes 5 shots.
@EliotShorrParks He's a huge concern. His acumen with this stuff is extremely troubling.
@EliotShorrParks Hasn't done anything for two months except rough the passer.
@AdamSchefter that doesn't sound right.
@triedguide Cool. I was just trying to figure out how they make money if they don't sign you up for auto renewal. Thank u for your feedback.

@Hoop_76 I always remember pre-2010 Cavs treating JJ HIckson like he was 24K gold.
@DavidKinateder @ZBerm That's a good point. And Maclin was doing a whole lot of nothing this year before getting hurt.
@_toddbloom @ColinJost You clearly have a certain point of view. Good luck to you.
@_toddbloom @ColinJost I don't agree with everything else you said, but YES, LAUGH!! Good grief, everything isn't an attack....
I can't believe @colinjost is catching flack for his Tinder joke. Remember when it was the right that couldn't laugh at itself?

@AFelms @Tim_McManus Yeah, he seems like a good dude. He just has to say "F it" at this point,  because he really can't play any worse.
@AFelms @Tim_McManus I think when he addressed that "no shit" comment a few days later, he said he has to get out of his own head.
@pitchfork You are a god damn idiot if you give this guy your money.
@Tim_McManus He more or less says this every week though, correct?
@JakePavorsky Even if he ever does anything in the NFL, it won't be here. Reminds me of Gavin Floyd, collapses under expectations.

@dcfootballfans @JoeBanner13 Interesting to see what they get for him. That $$, age, &amp; back injury is gonna be tough to navigate.
@JakePavorsky good grief
@JoeKaiserSports I mean, Philly has a pick swap with them &amp; their '19 pick. They are in a bad spot.
@JoeKaiserSports They have no other option than to trade Cousins.
@jords_mac @RawbM07 @SI_PeterKing @JennyVrentas @theMMQB to me, I just go by eye test with young players. Wentz just has all the skills.
@jords_mac @RawbM07 @SI_PeterKing @JennyVrentas @theMMQB Eagles have WR'S who can't go down field and can't catch. It's a bad combo.
@huhhowdoidothis @JoeBanner13 yeah, the NBA is the league for fans with "no hope". I disagree with Joe. MLB was worse off 20 years ago

@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 Same to you, sir.
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 wish you wouldn't hide behind snarky veneer. I'm sure there is a fan capable of intelligent sports talk somewhere in there
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 well that's one good point you made. I can certainly understand rooting for Eagles to lose.
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 they literally traded a #1 pick a few years ago for more players picks and players during draft. Jesus you are bad at this.
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 76ers traded MCW, Holiday, Young, &amp; Turner for picks, and were bad while rebuilding. Literally the same thing Browns doing.
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 jesus, you can't even troll correctly.
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 that is literally exactly what the 76ers did. Literally traded players for more picks.
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 you just gotta troll even when it doesn't make any sense....
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 how can you troll on the 76ers? Browns are following that exact model?
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 then I saw your timeline and started getting it. That's your persona, you troll, don't make legit points. I get it.
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 I wasn't ever trolling you. Made a legit point on inane comment you left and you immediately started trolling.
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 this just proves my point. We are comparing rookie QB's, not estsblished. Your ignorance just shins through again.
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490  but hey, if you get your kicks trolling, by all means, go for it. Only thing sadder than a twitter troll is an old troll
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 it's great that you actually keep going back to a meaningless stat to prove your ignorance on rookie QB evaluation.
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 I love after being disproven, you go back to that stat like it matters in the least.
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 just a sad guy trolling away on twitter non stop. I feel sorry for you, old man.

@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 I made a mistake replying to you in hopes of intelligent back &amp; forth. Judging by timeline, all you do is troll.
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 they also said Trump should be locked up for treason. So yeah, the country's favorite tabloid needs to be taken seriously
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 By your criteria, somebody like Mark Sanchez is one of the best rookie QB's in history. It's nonsense.
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 And you judge them on their attributes, and how they implement them. You know better than that. Stop being purposely obtuse
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 YPC is legit. Again, you don't turn the ball over when you are getting killed &amp; QB's are given 8 yard completions.

@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 @JoeBanner13 I get you are trolling. You evaluate young QB's on their skill sets, and how those skill sets are implemented
@7b8f2a3ee0bd490 @JoeBanner13 because he gets a ton of garbage time prevent defenses. Easiest way to pump up your completion % &amp; QBR.

@Jeff_McLane that's truly terrible.

@thayne_griffin No doubt, it's a dream matchup if you wanna see two guys go at it.
@thayne_griffin @JeffPassan Oh yeah, absolutely. Two biggest hotheads in the game trying to see who has the bigger dick.
@thayne_griffin @JeffPassan Ventura threw inside1st AB, &amp; Machado took offense &amp; ran his mouth.
@JonHeyman are teams other than the Phillies allowed to talk signing money with players?
Love rocking out #yourthemesongoffer https://t.co/uj04eC4Ql7
@JonHeyman did he take responsibility the 1st time?
@ryanlawrence21 In the words of Dave Montgomery, the fans will always want to see the old stars play, Ryan.
@JoeBanner13 @Lit_Whane @joshuavolz because he missed on a pick he was not good? There is also skill on flipping player while still valuable
@SpikeEskin this is what all of this is about.
@SpikeEskin Joe is upset because Browns are tanking this year to get #1. It drives him nuts people use this strategy to take old job.
@JoeBanner13 This Sixers rant is just a subtle knock on the Browns, who many feel are tanking this year to get #1 next year, right?
@LRiddickESPN For so long, the Warriors were the exact opposite of a model franchise....until they weren't.
@LRiddickESPN My point is, it's as equally foolish to dump on them right now as it is to proclaim "the process" a success.
@LRiddickESPN @warriors Another good question. How many years did the Warriors get it wrong (like 15?) until they got it right?
@JoeBanner13  @SportsCenter @ESPNSteinLine @chadfordinsider it's so much easier to say that when you have 22 starters to fill in, not 5.
@JoeBanner13 @SportsCenter @ESPNSteinLine @chadfordinsider you don't believe in drafting BPA?
I'm not a country music fan, but @garthbrooks is one of the few big names who charges a reasonable price for tickets.

Damn, the new Radiohead song is good.
@BillSimmons If Webber is gonna bitch about that foul, gotta call out Ginobili's toe went over the line into foul territory.
I would've preferred Aretha Franklin performing "Get Off" instead of "Purple Rain" at the White House.
@John_Faker Yup. Dating myself a bit, but Robert Gallery went 2nd 10 years ago behind Eli Manning. "Stud LT" for who turned into ok guard.
@NateSkaate @mnrtv @Ticketmaster Just chatted with a TM rep, apparently you have to do a chat or call to get refunded.
@NateSkaate @Ticketmaster Did you call them up or anything?
@Ticketmaster Any idea when there will be a refund option available in  my orders sec of my TM account for Beyonce Nashville postponement?
@BillSimmons I don't think Mother's Day is a sequel.
@JustinVerlander Agreed. Void the contract, too, if you feel that strongly. But the player's union fights for this stuff....
@AndrewBrandt he's very good at his job, though there is no doubt he is waving the white flag this year with Mark Sanchez.
@jmpayne24 @barrysvrluga I think so. Probably helps the legs in those dog days of August.
@WojVerticalNBA Does anybody like playing with Dwight?
@AndrewBrandt and he is one more mediocre season away from being viewed merely as a "caretaker" QB.
@AndrewBrandt There is a flipside. If he holds out to long, they don't trade him &amp; falls behind new playbook, it hurts his play next year

@cnnbrk This feels like an @TheOnion headline, unfortunately.

@_late2theparty_ damn man.....took me 45 mins to get my MSG's.
@_late2theparty_ @Drake @StubHub they didn't sell out in under a min. They release them in waves. Can't give up after 2 mins.
I'm not big hockey fan at all, but you watch the Flyers on the power play, &amp; it's amazing this is even a series.
@ZBerm Yeah, you hope they traded up because they love the guy, not reaching for a Gabbert type just because you have the need.
@AdamSchefter I get it, but he's also never given anyone a reason to believe he's a long term answer.
I'm ok with a ginger being a geek on the wrong side of unrequited love in a posh British romantic comedy, but not as my starting QB.
I guess my biggest problem with Carson Wentz is that he's a ginger.
@Hilary_Weissman it's actually just a regular shop, not a ship. That would be more awesome than I could handle if it was a candy ship.
@Hilary_Weissman plus they have a huge candy ship right next door that I believe is open all night if you have a sweet tooth.

@jdahline @bigreno4 @jemorcats Exactly. "They took a stand!" Everyone applauds them. But they screwed a bunch of their own fans.
@jdahline @bigreno4 @jemorcats A) I don't live in NC. This hasn't effected me at all.
@jdahline @bigreno4 @jemorcats and frankly, a bit self serving.
@jdahline @bigreno4 @jemorcats understand the logic, I just think it's crummy to use your fans wallets to make your point.
@bigreno4 @jemorcats You are being silly. There is no reason they couldn't have, at the least,  cancelled the show a while ago.
@bigreno4 @jemorcats @PearlJamIf I don't know what to tell you if you can't empathize with people who lose $$ because of last minute cancels
@jemorcats @PearlJam I sympathize. There was no good reason they needed to wait until 48 hours before the show to do this.
Exactlty.....canceling shows, particularly 1 or 2 days in advance, isn't the answer. https://t.co/eWMkQnuMTf

@HARRYMAYES975 I mean, I get the fact a coach doesn't want to lose on purpose. But I never hear a better plan from him how to get better.
@HARRYMAYES975 Larry kinda contracted himself, huh? Hate tanking, says "u build a good team through young players &amp; draft picks" right after
@rjclifestyle @ProFootballTalk honestly, I think everything is a smokecreen at this point. Eagles "loving EE" gets leaked for a reason.
@rjclifestyle @ProFootballTalk I'm hearing QB has been a smokescreen
@gonzoCSN you asked some really great questions during that press conference.
@WindhorstESPN It took some balls for Josh Harris to say his Dad was not involved in the hiring process at all.
@JoeBanner13 When he took Embiid &amp; Saric in same draft, he got too obsessed with "optionality" &amp; pushing timelines back.
@TMobileArena @gunsnroses Ahhh, nevermind, I see, you guys are jacking up the prices at the last minute.
@TMobileArena @gunsnroses  Why did the listed price for the GA tickets just go up from $350 to $450?
@AdamSchefter So maybe he'll be the best QB? Pretty strong statement.
@DerekBodnerNBA I can't wait for the Colangelo ' s to guide us back into basketball purgatory again.
@RollingStone it's actually because the tickets weren't selling at all.
@laurenmorannn buy them on stubhub day of show. It's going to be a buyers market. They'll be way below face value.
@shwamusic stadiums turn into a bloodbath on the secondary market.

"Can male hipsters even get erections or would that be advocating a position of privilege?" -Comment on article I read that made me laugh.

@stevecuozzo this is uneccessarily mean spirited.
@CoreySeidmanCSN I think Boston is looking for a top of the rotation type of guy. Strong 1 or 2.
@docktora I feel bad for them. They look completely demoralized out there in OT, like they know it's over.
@BillSimmons I don't see any magical elixir keeping Davis healthy to turn into a dynasty in this lifetime
@radiohead I understand you think you are doing good but it really only limits real fans from seeing you guys.
@radiohead scalpers buy a pair then list 1 ridiculously overpriced, then escort fan in &amp; leave.
@pitchfork @radiohead the problem is the guys making $12 an hour at the door don't give a fuck about checking id's.
@klockraydeo @radiohead @thomyorke all scalpers will do is buy a pair, overcharge for 1 on stubhub, escort buyer in, then leave. So stupid.
@Ken_Rosenthal does the main character have a punny name, like "Jesse Pitchford"?
@BA_Hatch @RedSox Did you figure this out? I'm trying to follow the directions they give on the website and nothing works. What a disaster.

@Buster_ESPN I dunno. Phillies COULD pay Chris Davis &amp; Mike Leake, but do you honestly think that'd be the smart play?
@Matt_Winkelman I love this mentality. Then go ahead &amp; ask any "expert" how Edwin Jackson worked out for the Cubs a few years ago.

@EvanDrellich As a Phils fan, there is not 1 trade I'd take back from their 08-11 run, even if some prospects have panned out well. Worth it
@jaysonst yeah I'd love to hear you reanalayze this trade now.

@EnglishAg7 @brianmctaggart I forgret, what did the Astros get back when they traded Cosart?

@norabovic @BobbyMarks42 keep adding good young talent in the draft and players will want to come. Simple as that.

@Dustin_Gale12 @chadfordinsider I agree about coaching. It's unrealistic anyway. Even if Lakers now pined for Oakafor, teams don't admit...
@Dustin_Gale12 @chadfordinsider True, but they thought they'd sell all the free agents on just the "glitz &amp; glamour" of LA. Not well run.
@chadfordinsider I'd consider it from the Sixers side if the Lakers would agree to remove the protection from this years draft pick.
In fact, I'm surprised there isn't a song called "Middle of the Road".

Shocking the Eagles game ends with a drop.
@Tim_McManus You can just copy &amp; paste this every game.
@LRiddickESPN Bradford also put that exactly where it needed to be. These WR's just don't make plays.
@ZBerm It'd be nice to see a WR make a tough catch every once in a while.

In my experience, the guy at the gym wearing the Dawn of the Dead t-shirt generally isn't the most ripped.
@JeffPassan The most reasonable comment on the matter.
@ryanlawrence21 But man, both those guys made really risky plays where there was no doubt they were gonna get blown up. They assumed risk.
@ryanlawrence21 Notice everyone stopped saying "he left himself exposed" after they found out Tejeda broke his leg. Like Posey's torn ACL.
@Gigantes42 @ryanlawrence21 I love this tweet. You'd think it was Steve Urkel or something who just attempted that takeout slide.
@Ken_Rosenthal I bet Utley would have no qualms with that slide had HE left himself that vulnerable trying to pirouette a double play.
@USAF4life @TimKeownESPN @KeithOlbermann Reminds me of Posey play from few years ago. Both fielders left themselves VERY vulnerable.

@DerekBodnerNBA I understand the casual fans reaction to this. My dad hates them for this after Bynum debacle &amp; Brand damaged goods.
@Michael_Levin Yeah, I never understood that. It's the "Chip can go back to college anytime he wants" argument.
@DariosDentist If u don't think there is an issue with being intentionally vague &amp; murky with your stars injury, I don't know what to tell u
@DariosDentist @JakePavorsky Agree to disagree. When dealing with the pearl of the rebuild, I feel like I need clarity. Its still awful news
@DariosDentist @JakePavorsky That's fine. I understand they are tight lipped. In my eyes, there are circumstances FO needs to communicate.
@JakePavorsky In that sense I wonder what else they'll be intentionally unclear about in the future.
@JakePavorsky It does speak somewhat  poorly to the character of the organization in the way they go about their communications.
@ScottONeil @gonzoCSN Can't wait for the next ACL injury. Won't be classified as a "tear", just "ACL stopped functioning fully"

@highkin Weird. That's good to hear. I always thought he was a curmudgeon because he'd constantly rag on everybody doing NBA commentary.
@jcrasnick @ryanlawrence21 YES!!! The Philles are Thurman Murman. Seems like in all trade talks really.
@jcrasnick @ryanlawrence21 If you've seen Bad Santa, during the chess scene, Papelbon is Billy Bob, &amp; the Phillies are the fat kid.
@philliesnation Of course it is. Why would a team who has been repeatedly burned by keeping players too long be in a rush to do anything?
@_hot_lips_ @CSNPhilly Talk themselves into thinking "if we wait, his trade value will improve". All it does is destroy old players value.
@CSNPhilly @CoreySeidmanCSN @SportsRadioWIP Papelbon can see though, like any fan, that the front office drags their feet doing anything.
@nickcafardo @BostonGlobe I've seen others argue he never bet against Reds, but that fact is irrelevant.I'd lean towards "no".
@Chris_Broussard Yeah, this Ramona Shelburne article today seems to indicate Cuban had been to Jordan's house &amp; knew where it was.
You know, if you listen to the Papelbon quote in full, he's not really wrong at all regarding the Phillies &amp; how they go about things.
@TheLollipopking "Dim Witted" is the wrong phrase. Those who are technologically antsy &amp; don't shop around is better.
Shopping for a new phone, why would anybody use Verizon Edge or AT&amp;T Next? They seemed designed to rip off the dim witted.
@ryanlawrence21 Ruben would lead you to believe it's merely because they've had low first round picks the last decade or so.
@hoopscritic @975TheFanatic it's a fun debate, I just think it's as silly to admonish what 76ers are doing as it is to call Hinkie a genius
@hoopscritic @kwill44 @975TheFanatic you are right, but they are in a position now where they need Jabrari to be a star to contend.
@hoopscritic @kwill44 @975TheFanatic did they turn into the team they are because they change their culture, or they just had good players?
@hoopscritic @kwill44 @975TheFanatic in GSW's case, how many years did they miss the playoffs?
@hoopscritic @kwill44 @975TheFanatic what is in between?
@kwill44 @hoopscritic @975TheFanatic &amp; lets be honest, they basically tried a different way for 7 years where they were borderline lottery.
@kwill44 @hoopscritic @975TheFanatic it's an interesting point. Flipside is Kings have had picked between 5-12 for 9 years &amp; are shit.
@jakemkaplan Great article today.I'm amazed a team that has gotten so screwed by waiting on things thinks it might be good to hold on Hamels
@IanRiccaboni @philliesnation Haha, great comparison. He was "Darin Ruf" before Ruf reached martyr status in this city.
@philliesnation @IanRiccaboni Matt Rizzotti for Hunter Pence was a popular one in 2011.
I think I could write a hit country song in like 5 seconds. Something about drinking whiskey on the weekend down by the creek.
@Michael_Levin ehh, gave I meant. You get my drift.
@Michael_Levin it's crazy people will still bitch about Webber occasionally. We have up 3 pieces of garbage for him.
@BillSimmons if it's rebroken is disasterous. If it's taking longer to heal because he's still growing just gotta be patient
@PhilaPhans I hope so. With the lack of real info we have, I think any long term speculation either way is a but risky at the moment.
@PhilaPhans @BobCooney76 you seem like you've done some research. What is the track record of guys who had 2nd surgery to "promote healing"?
@PhilaPhans @BobCooney76 well, I mean, are we 100% positive this isn't reinjury? Again, I don't feel like we've gotten the whole story.
@BobCooney76 @PhilaPhans I think the # of players who had multiple surgeries on that bone &amp; played effectively after are like nil.
@BobCooney76 I  kind of shrugged it off at time, but you wonder if those reports of his missing treatments &amp; overall immaturity played part.
@BobCooney76 there's a lot about this that doesn't pass the smell test. We haven heard the whole story about what caused a lack of healing.
@gonzoCSN well, according to his Instagram, he's not fat anymore. So at least we have that!
@jonmorosi isn't he gonna hit his innings limit before the playoffs?
@docktora @teamziller I'm still partial to the Boozer/CLE contract fiasco.
@docktora Is there any legit talk of having planned this or are you just speculating?
I pine for the days people used to refer to testicles as "nards".
@BillSimmons Just duct tape them for a week, then file them off. All good.
@hoopscritic Correct. From a business stand point, it's the only way he'll save his reputation if he shows he doesn't endorse this.
@CoreySeidmanCSN In theory, though, Wes Matthews could back out since Jordan might not sign with Mavs, &amp; take Kings deal.
@ryanlawrence21 @slaven_20 I can't tell if he's trolling or serious?
@ToddZolecki Holding on to Hamels was probably wise, but if he isn't gone at the trade deadline, there is a problem with the asking price.

@DerekBodnerNBA @SteveBalalis I love looking back at that stuff. I mean, you guys were pretty much spot on, but always 1 or 2 wild cards.
@DerekBodnerNBA @SteveBalalis Ah, ok. I was going by the first one I found after last years draft. Sometime in July.
@DerekBodnerNBA @SteveBalalis nah, Towns was like 4 or 5.
@SteveBalalis @DerekBodnerNBA I think Oakafor. Mudiay was #3 if I remember correctly.

@shwamusic It's a bit sexist to assume it's a guy. I'd amend the tweet suggesting it could also be a woman with a wide vagina.
@Michael_Levin The great thing is, I don't see how Kings &amp; Lakers could even have a punchers chance at making the playoffs.
@Itwasmeanttobe9 I still don't trust Kobe to stay healthy. Is the 2018 pick unprotected?
@simmnfierzig @Itwasmeanttobe9 @kpelton Also don't think any FA's by this point are going to help the Sixers move the needle to "good".
@DerekBodnerNBA For kicks, I took a look at Draft Express 1st mock for 2015 last year. Cliff Alexander (!) #2, D'Angelo Russel not drafted.
@BillSimmons Aren't the Suns just gonna be the new Blazers if he signs there?
@MBarkannCSN re: mid season grades, It doesn't matter who hits behind Ryan Howard because pitchers aren't afraid to pitch to him anyway.
@HoopsRumors @JakeLFischer it really speaks to the poor character of that org that teams think they might even think about pulling out.
@MrJustinPowell I see him walking his dogs on the upper east side a lot. Seems like a lot more, but he was only in like, 4 90's movies.
@JakePavorsky Oh. Fun.
@CoreySeidmanCSN It wouldn't be advantageous to the Sixers in the least if Saric was involved.
@SheaSerrano I have no interest in Hip Hop music, other than for high school nostalgia, but the end of the piece was so wonderfully written
@DerekBodnerNBA @JakeMarc23 I mean, he had no pain when they initially diagnosed it, but everyone agreed a surgery was necessary.
@DerekBodnerNBA @JakeMarc23 Right, but from what I understand, it can feel fine, not be fully healed, &amp; then workout just destroys it.
@guitarfer88 @DerekBodnerNBA @JakeMarc23 I dunno....that bone ruins guys careers. I would think Embiid's ppl would be MORE cautious.
@BillSimmons Ainge offered a bunch of Godfathers III's. Not appealing.

@KBergCBS Phil sounded like he was coming out of a funeral.
@AlexKennedyNBA ahhh, I see. Thanks.
@AlexKennedyNBA just wondering, what is the point of "promising" anybody you are going to pick them?
@Michael_Levin I don't agree with you on pretty much anything, but if Kings decide to trade Cousins, they are sitting pretty.
@MikeGarafolo @WojYahooNBA or stop following him until the draft is over. It's not that hard.
@DerekBodnerNBA maybe I'm crazy but I'd love to see Hinkie make a crazy offer to try and get Mudiay in next 2-3 picks.
@gonzoCSN an I wouldn't be shocked if Noel gets moved too.
@gonzoCSN can't take anyone else over him. Bad teams draft for need in this spot, especially considering Embiids health.
@MikeMiss975 agreed. Glad they didn't over think it.
@BobCooney76 if Embiid is healthy you'll always be able to trade a big in this league.
@BobCooney76 smart pick considering Embiid is up on the air.
@DerekBodnerNBA it's the smart pick either way. Just picking another player over him would be silly.
@MikeMiss975 couldn't listen this week, did you still want Oakafor over Russel?
@CoreySeidmanCSN They have a couple Nets picks, but I don't see how a bunch of decent assets buys you #3.
@BillSimmons Noel &amp; 3 for Smart, Olynk, 16, 28. I'm shaking my damn head.
@BillSimmons sounds like the Celtics are offering shitty trade proposals to everyone right before the draft!
@CVivlamoreAJC @SpearsNBAYahoo they look like uniforms made for people who call things they like "dope".
@JeffPassan Man, can you imagine if the ball ricocheted off his hand &amp; hit the baby in the face? He'd be a huge villain. Such a fine line.
@Sullivan_Ranger All those awesome young studs they didn't trade for him a few years ago say "hello".
@HoopsRumors sweet god what a terrible offer.
If every film had scene where someone tries on 30 outfits while friend judges their choice outside the dressing room, I'd feel a lot better.
@CGillespie88 @Michael_Levin If he's a stud, I can't argue against trading up for him...but yeah, I fear they take Porzingis over Russel too
@CGillespie88 @Michael_Levin that is why he's advocating a trade up, though it sounds like MIN has already decided on him.
@ToddZolecki sounds like at this point Rube is GM in name only? That has to be a positive, right?
@Ken_Rosenthal they are too cheap to go &amp; get anyone else, &amp; it will cost them a playoff spot.
@CoreySeidmanCSN That's what Rube doesn't get. Nobody is complaining they're losing, it's that their asses are handed to them nightly.
@DerekBodnerNBA Death, Taxes, &amp; Phillippe Aumont.
@ToddZolecki Did Sandberg ever give a reason why he was pulled so early?
@ryanlawrence21 you should just write that in every time a Phillies game starts to go to shit this year.
@Michael_Levin I feel like we need a tangible home run from a pick before we start throwing stuff like this out there.
RT @thejeffoneal: “We’ll never know why this happened” says a state with virtually no gun laws and whose capitol flies the confederate flag
@Ken_Rosenthal They have to fire Sandberg soon. What this bullpen phone incident shows is that players clearly don't have respect for him.
@docktora  Iggy shot 82% from the line one year, &amp; was in the 73-78ish range his first six seasons. It's amazing how bad he's gotten.
@ToddZolecki I can't tell even tell if this is serious, but if it is, Sandberg should be fired ASAP, because they clearly don't respect him.
RT @RoobCSN: Two runs and an injury on a wild pitch? Only one team on Earth can do that.

@jonmorosi what the heck does Detroit have to trade at this point?
@MikeDrucker Does it convincingly get you into the story, or is it like "Dude, the Dinosaurs are loose......AGAIN!!"
I thought The Rolling Stones charged a lot for tickets; then I saw what @taylorswift13 charges.
@jonmorosi To anybody who reads this: They don't have the prospects to get anybody good. Best case scenario would be Aaron Harang.

@gonzoCSN Yeah so weird....
"thank you for showing up one month out of every season once we gave you a $45 million deal."
@RonJAdams @JoeBanner13 @billbarnwell Yeah, I believe you are right.
@RonJAdams @JoeBanner13 @billbarnwell It doesn't. He's implying for Maclin resigning elsewhere.
@Jeff_McLane This doesn't really SEEM in poor form to withdraw an offer that was sitting there for 4 months, but is it odd for NFL?
@karabellespn and a split of half the winnings if he makes it in the money (not cool). I feel weird. How do I procede from here on out?

@sakuralovestea You can see Gosling's talent as a director, but it's really just self indulgent nonsense. It's a chore to sit through.

@CoreySeidmanCSN players well into their late 30's was a good idea, I'd keep my mouth shut.

@shwamusic I think they were going to buy McCourtey and go cheap with Gore at RB. I agree.
@shwamusic and as soon as he does things out of the norm people call him@an idiot.
@shwamusic though I do buy that it's kind of crazy too get excited about a coach that's doing things differently &amp; change up the system..
@shwamusic nah, not even debating these are good moves. Just the notion that he literally puts no thought into this stuff.

@GeoffMosherCSN I'm surprised they paid him high end value. Thought they'd get him at their price.
@EliotShorrParks I've gotta be honest, I kind of thought they'd be getting Demarco for their price, not essentially paying market price.
@MattLombardo975 Totally agreed, though I could also see Mathews not wanting a backup role.
@RossTuckerNFL if it's true isn't that deal essentially on the table until the draft?
@JimmyKempski Pure speculation or whispers?
@975TheFanatic Whole fan base just did a total 180 on Chip with that move. I've never seen anything like it.
@SandoESPN @LesBowen with a reputation going out that they were completely clueless &amp; ruined a franchise.
@SandoESPN @LesBowen I hear you, but anyone with self respect doesn't want to be sent packing as a laughingstock....
@EliotShorrParks Yeah, if he's your guy, how do you NOT work out an extension before trade? Why trade a  2 &amp; 4 to audition a guy for a year?
RT @scottbails13: @ByDavidMurphy But that would mean that Chip is an idiot.

And that ruins everything.
@ByDavidMurphy Rams taking Mariotta. They just traded a 5th rd pick for their back up, Nick Foles.
@MattLombardo975 Makes no sense. Why not do a team friendly extension if you love him so much? Why pay a 2 &amp; 4 to look at a guy for a year?
@davespadaro Then why aren't they extending him? Why would u trade #2 &amp;#4 to look at a guy for a year? And they traded Foles for the #5.
@MikeMiss975 Even if Chip thinks he's the bee knees, how do you trade that haul for a guy with ACL's made out of tissue paper?
@adbrandt Agreed, but I believe Bradford's ACL's would've torn anywhere.
@SI_PeterKing I'm an Eagles fan that wants to strangle him, Peter.
@gonzoCSN you missed it, the whole city just turned on Chip Kelly. It was amazing.
@ByDavidMurphy even if you wanted to evaluate him for a year. Has no weapons around him now. Just like in STL.
@DerekBodnerNBA it's like the Eagles are "dumb Sixers". I've never been so angered as a fan in my life.
@Jeff_McLane @AlbertBreer that is just so egregiously awful.
God bless you, @GeoffMosherCSN trying to explain this trade as being brilliant on CSN, but your explanation makes no sense.
@MattLombardo975 no defending that trade. This is awful.
@Jeff_McLane that's indefensible. That's awful.
@GeoffMosherCSN I can't see the end game her being Sam Bradford, coming off 2 torn ACL's, with no offensive weapons.
@TheLollipopking I take that back... I wouldn't look at any other girl except my girlfriend...
I'd rescind my offer to Frank Gore right now. He's a car with 160,000 miles on it that could die any second. Never understood it. #Eagles
@gonzoCSN Do you think it's possible Chip reneged on the deal because he found out Frank Gore wasn't white?
@CoreySeidman @mikefreemanNFL only problem I have is signing. 32 yr old RB. Could conceivably be washed up at a moments notice.
Every woman at my gym is stunningly beautiful today. I feel like the kid in Last Action Hero.
@_hot_lips_ and after their 7th season, football Gods aren't too kind. tiki barber only guy to buck that trend somehow.
@_hot_lips_ I think my explanation only works BECAUSE you need multiple defensive players. RB easiest position to replace.
@_hot_lips_ sure, but saving $9.5 million will help bring in another defensive piece.
Unless he's Tiki Barber, trading LeSean McCoy while he's still at peak value for a stud LB on a rookie contract might not be the worst thing

@ZBerm @Jeff_McLane PHI-BUF at the Linc is gonna be fun this year, huh?

He's had a bunch of box office hits, but not one movie everyone particularly agrees is good. It's the weirdest career ever.
And I just noticed he makes these most mediocre movies of anybody ever. None are great, some are good, most are ok, some are bad.
I don't even dislike Will Smith or anything, but all these career retrospectives have been coming out today because of his new movie.
If you made a biography on Will Smith movies, it'd be called "Ehhh....It's Alright I Guess: The Will Smith story"
@BillSimmons Will Smith makes movies no one passionately loves 10 years later, but you don't mind on in the background while you pay bills.
@BillSimmons Your article couple years ago summed up Will Smith better. Cinema's Celine Dion. Bunch of hits but no one loves their work.
Will Smith should just come out &amp; say "man, I really wish I did Django Unchained" than just tap dance around it in every interview.

@Buster_ESPN they have the market cornered on #3 SP's.
@shadsman15 @nickcafardo Agreed, I think they are lacking a #1 AND #2
@alexspeier Gonna be hard to contend without a legit #1 or #2.
Wow, didn't see Jimmy Rollins being the first Phillie traded this off season.
@Geeeeemen @MatthewBerryTMR You beat me to it. ESPN does it. Yahoo doesn't penalize for pick 6's. It drives me nuts.
@CoreySeidman @philliesnation Probably the best moment of next season would be the ovation he gets in his first game back though.
@Buster_ESPN I actually wonder if they take a legit shot at Hamels now. Thought they might wait a year if they didn't get Lester.
@Buster_ESPN I can't believe Red Sox fans thought he might go back. Once you didn't resign him last year, he was only gonna cost more....
@JeffPassan As others pointed out, state taxes would negate the extra money.
@Ken_Rosenthal That's so dumb, honestly, what is the point?
@alexspeier I love quotes like this. What's he gonna say. "we'll take anything for Hamels!"??
@MattGelb 2015 Phillies Tagline: "Loyalty"
@ByDavidMurphy No.
@Ken_Rosenthal don't they need both to "contend". Or at the least, two VERY good pitchers to have a respectable rotation?

@Hilary_Weissman is that Gomey on the float with him???
@ByDavidMurphy It's called "Nick Young syndrome".
@ByDavidMurphy Seems a number of teams soured on him, not just Phillies, if he could only get $68m.
@jaysonst Have the Phillies made it clear to Rollins they have not interest in resigning him next season?
@jaysonst I'm all for moving on, but it's a crap offer. Quality SS's are hard to find.
@jaysonst RAJ's seat is so hot he isn't gonna make a deal with anyone for fear of getting too little in return.
@jaysonst Yes, holding off has served the Phillies well the past few years....
@jaysonst He had a new soft tissue injury every 10 days last season.
@hbryant42 @ryanlawrence21 No doubt 12 shots seems ridiculously unnecessary, but cops aren't trained to shoot in the leg. It's hard to do.
@SI_PeterKing Cute tie in to the Ferguson announcement.
@DaNStu_ @JeffPassan don't think they would want Cespedes. I could see him going for a mid rotation SP to a contender looking for offense.
@Ken_Rosenthal @JeffPassan What a time to be a fairly good ballplayer, huh?
@nickcafardo @davis91389 no doubt you could trade him for a fine starter. Phillies wouldn't really want him though, where they are at.

Hey @Phillies , want to get fans interested after watching bad, boring baseball past few years? Hire @RaysJoeMaddon &amp; sign Yasmani Tomas.
@IanRiccaboni  Nah, Phils will realize next off season that they should have made a play for Maddon,which of course will be too late.

@jcouvy @HeidiWatney @BertDbacks You can run inside the the line.
@jcouvy @HeidiWatney @BertDbacks Not reviewable. Haven't seen a replay, so I don't know where Aybar initially created his path to the base.
@jamesvenes Contact doesn't matter, from what I understand. Moss could've just been in the way as soon as he didn't make the play.
@jamesvenes "After a fielder has made an attempt to field a ball and missed, he can no longer be in the "act of fielding" the ball"
@jamesvenes I think umpires could technically argue as soon as Moss whiffed on the ball, he was then obstructing the runner.
@HeidiWatney @BertDbacks I think you could call it on Moss though, who technically missed fielding the ball, then obstructed the lane.
@shwamusic I figured if I called the guy a cum receptacle, @sonicdrivein wouldn't give me a retweet.

@Michael_Levin c'mon, Bob Cooney was the only guy reporting that. He never gets any news scoops at all. All he does is summarize games.
@BobCooney76 haven't heard anything from anyone else. You still standing bye your Thad/ABent trade?

@DarrenWolfson @MNSPORTSFAN123 Oh, ok. I thought Min would deal Bennett for him. Yeah, no Bennett makes deal heck of a lot harder.
@IanRiccaboni Was this confirmed by anyone else other than @MikeMiss975 ?
@MNSPORTSFAN123 @DarrenWolfson They'll be terrible with or without Thad, but I'd be surprised if Bennett for Thad doesn't get done.
@gonzoCSN There is a MN beat writer that is saying Min trying to add Philly into trade. They have like, three weeks to do it still.

@ByDavidMurphy It warranted more discussion; why are the Phillies SO behind the times?
@ByDavidMurphy Liked your point on Phils not recognizing value of young talent like rest of orgs. Wish Barkann didn't abruptly change topic.
@jonahkeri Instead of calling him by his real name, just call him Jesse Pinkman and tell him you love his work.
@Aisle424 @Buster_ESPN @BleacherNation Another wrench in Cubs plan would be they are on No trade list. I'd be surprised if Hamels approved.
That last tweet I quoted was originally from last December. I am a modern Nostradamus.
"Wanting to move Rollins &amp; Papelbon right after their value declines proves Amaro will wait too long to deal Cliff Lee &amp; screw that up too."

I think we are at the point where Phillies fans can begin asking themselves.... #philliestalk
This Jim Bowden shit is great.
@JeffPassan they could pay him $135 million next year and the team can't get any worse.
@AcunaAndrew @MattGelb yup. He was a viable chip last deadline and off season. Wait too long with old players...and shit happens.
@MattGelb Seemed like there was a lot of aggressiveness today. I get it....he can't come out and say I signed a bunch of junk no one wants.
@jcrasnick Speaks volumes to the poor roster Amaro constructed, but also, realistically, Phillies trade deadline is 8/31
@JeffPassan you have to give him an extension, or expect him to retire.
@ByDavidMurphy @Ken_Rosenthal @pgammo wow. Love these moves for Bos. Not working, change it. They are the anti-Phillies.
@Buster_ESPN YOU SAID GOOD A MINUTE AGO, BUSTER......SO WE ARE CHANGING THE TERMS NOW??????
@MattGelb Yeah, clearing money does them no good. No one they can buy that will magically turn them into contender in a year or 2.
@word_real_estat @AmericanExpress that sucks dude
At the end of the day, I just don't think the @Phillies have the balls to trade Cole Hamels.
@Ken_Rosenthal Feels like he's in the position (Riccardi?) TOR's GM was a few years ago with Halladay. Needs to hit a HR to save job.
@jaysonst @UnivestCorp Dunn and fielder?
@ByDavidMurphy Absolutely. It was a good article. I also understand most people not wanting to hear how hard it can be being Ryan  Howard.
@ByDavidMurphy Had this convo w/ friend the other day. One drawback of today's insane $$: Can't feel sorry for dude making $25mil a year.
@JeffPassan they really need a new GM to clean house.
@JeffPassan the problem with the Phillies is the GM who signed bad deals or waited too long to trade is now trying to save face in trades.
@shwamusic @nfl Still smarting from wasting your 2nd pick last year, huh?
@ShaqqDaddy32_ @nfl I don't think it's technically their property to release. The hotel would have to do that.

@jodymacman If you can lay out a plan where the Phillies become contenders by the last year of his contract, I'm all for keeping him
@matthewpouliot as a Phillies fan, that is probably the only contract out there worse than Howard's.
A couple of ( I assume gay?) guys just whistled at me and catcalled me while running in the park #flattered #egoboost
@MattGelb I totally understand his initial embarrassment and anger....I just hope it doesn't last or this town will turn on him for good.
@shwamusic and Kruk said when players start saying "it's just a game", they've given up. No answers, no it's not gonna get any better.
@shwamusic and that short of a "Florida marlins" type fire sale, a GM couldn't have screwed up a franchise as quickly as RAJ.
@shwamusic Radio. 97.5. Basically said they are in as bad a position as anyone in MLB, it's gonna take a 5 year rebuild....
Lenny Dykstra with surprisingly lucid comments on how bad of a GM Amaro has been. Gold on the @MikeMiss975 show today.
Damn, John Kruk on Ryan Howard's "just a game comments". Hard to believe how far he fell.
@JonHeymanCBS aren't 1B's supposed to have higher slugging %'s though, generally?
@JonHeymanCBS I know Charlie Manuel would always complain on WIP that Howard didn't watch enough tape. I guess he could justify it then.
@JonHeymanCBS Sandberg made a vague comment about Howard not "making adjustments". I wonder if they don't feel he's working hard enough.
@ToddZolecki I found his comments about Howard needing to adjust interesting. Was he implying Ryan isn't doing enough to improve on his own?
@jonmorosi And somehow he won't even be closing....
@MattGelb Are there any other trade chips we can injure before the deadline?
@Buster_ESPN They don't believe in these advanced techniques like "instant replay".
@JSalisburyCSN He's the one guy who could never admit he wanted a change of scenary. People would just laugh. It would bring embarrassment.

@IanRiccaboni it was always so evident they loved playing with each other. Then it just wasn't. You are prob right about the injuries.
@IanRiccaboni and somehow a team full of vets who know how to win developed into a bad clubhouse, by all accounts. Curious how that happened
@IanRiccaboni it's actually 1 thing that never gets talked about. Used to be a great team that had a good clubhouse.
@IanRiccaboni I genuinely believe salary dumps do them no good, but they also need to change team culture in the worst way.

@philliesnation @Buster_ESPN If they aren't at least dipping their toes in those waters, they are a delusional franchise.
Former player Marlon Anderson is talking about Phillies contracts, and he doesn't seem to know what makes a player valuable or not at all.
@Buster_ESPN @ByDavidMurphy Doesn't it make sense to just invest in player next year they don't think is injury risk, if concern was legit?
@MattGelb @JonHeymanCBS Any word on the rumors the Phillies would prefer to trade Marlon Byrd over Chase Utley?
@IanRiccaboni obviously depends on caliber of prospect they could get back, if any, in salary dump scenarios.
@IanRiccaboni salary dumps would have interested me 2 years ago. Now, unfortunately, they are a lost cause.
@IanRiccaboni I mean, say you dump some those guys, and add even players like Hanley &amp; Scherzer in FA. Do they contend? Prob not.
@IanRiccaboni young base that the Sox still had to work with. So they just have to reinvest that $$$ again to try and be competitive.
@IanRiccaboni the problem with salary dump scenarios is that the Phil's are gonna be bad next 2-3 regardless. You don't have any sort of...
@IanRiccaboni @philliesnation Not sure that scenario accomplishes much, aside from the possibility of a longer potential sunk cost contract
@ByDavidMurphy but I also things change a lot in the last 24 hours before the deadline.
@ByDavidMurphy in that sense, I think to a degree, management really misread where the game was heading.
Everything is misogynistic these days. Hell, THIS tweet probably is in some way.

@magelb It's better than that human cesspool crammed into a little corner at CBP trying to smoke.
@sethedel @folger2will their best play is too trade him in 2 years. Aren't gonna win with or without him in future, so best to have asset
@adamlevitan you counted your chickens way too early, young man.
@ESPNSteinLine I would love the thought of Lakers helping HOU becoming a powerhouse after Dwight bolting for greener pastures last year.
@DJTatWGC @Buster_ESPN If they give up on Lester, they'd trade prospects to PHL, then trade Lester to contender for something. Not to PHL.
@DJTatWGC @Buster_ESPN well, if they are dealing prospects it makes sense. But Lester being involved doesn't.
@DJTatWGC @Buster_ESPN Lester is a free agent at the end of the year.
@Dallosto10 @inthewayof Yeah, Phillies are looking for prospects, not salary dump, unless Yanks take virtually EVERY bad deal.
@jonmorosi @FOXSports1 Can't see Phillies doing a straight salary dump unless Howard is involved. They know they need prospects badly.
@adbrandt Can't compare NBA to any other sport. One player on his own makes you a contender in NBA. That's where the leverage lies.
@ByDavidMurphy I don't understand. Last week on air, he said he still thought it was a good move at the time. Never shied away from that.
@ByDavidMurphy People bitch about Papelbon wanting to leave. People bitch about Utley &amp; JRoll refusing to leave. Lesson: people bitch.
@magelb They've simply decided they don't like him. If Chase said that, people would be admiring his will to win.
@BOBTPHLY444 @BobCooney76 Surprised I never hear anyone compare him to Ben Wallace. That's EXACTLY the player I see him being.
@ryanlawrence21 That makes complete sense to me. I'm amazed too that Jimmy &amp; Chase might wanna stay.
@BillSimmons fascinating legacy questions if he goes back.
@calebhannan I love that you are still in hiding. 6 month lockdown from Grantland and counting!

@Lanejohnson65 I guess that explains how you "bulked up" this summer. Do us a favor and do it the natural way here on out.
@gonzoCSN In all fairness, a few months ago, he sneezed on a train, I said "Bless you", and he didn't say thank you. So I root against him.
@gonzoCSN I thought you killed it against DJ on PST.
@gonzoCSN Cute
Ray Didinger is far &amp; away my favorite Philly radio analyst, so I'm shocked at how small minded &amp; shortsighted he is regarding @Sixers draft
@BobCooney76 my concern re: Tank Job #2 are bad habits MCW is picking up become ingrained in him as a player going forward.
@adbrandt @Sixers My only concern re: Tank Job pt.2. MCW picking up bad habits a 2nd year in a row that start to become ingrained.
@Steven_Hyden I'd flipe GCT &amp; GF. Kill the Moonlight indisputable #1.
@975TheFanatic @Sixers love you guys blasting the pick for an hour then immediately welcoming him on the air!
@TheIdleRich @LesBowen I don't get the sour grapes. He zigged when everyone in sports media was zagging.
Would've liked @Sixers moves a lot better if Hinkie took Doug McD, flipped for 16 &amp; 19, then got Saric &amp; Gary Harris.
@MikeSielski That's silly. But you can't be surprised if people want to check out this year.
@WojYahooNBA Is it protected?
@amyfadoolCSN I can't do another tank year, Fadool! I wasn't expecting playoffs, but I needed to see some progress!
@gonzoCSN @amyfadoolCSN @ZachLowe_NBA They are getting Orlando's heavily protected pick. It's a crap pick.
The @Sixers just took two guys who won't play next year. I want to put a bullet in my brain.
@WojYahooNBA I am a Sixers fan. I can't take another year of this crap.
@KBergCBS What is the throw in? I am a Sixers fan. I want to die.
@gonzoCSN @daldridgetnt God please kill me. Why am I a Sixers fan?
@chadfordinsider Oh my god, you got something wrong!
@chadfordinsider God what a waste. Why am I even a Sixers fan?
@gonzoCSN Hated Vonleh at #3. Love him at #10. Also, trade Thad Young to Sac for Ben Mclemore!!
@michaelgrange @NK975 God pleas let this be a friggin joke.
@chadfordinsider If you think he's a superstar, you do it. But if he's not....down the road, it's probably a job killer.
My non-Wiggins dream scenario for @Sixers tonight is Exum at #3, trade MCW for #7, take Randle, &amp; draft Staskus at #10.
@WojYahooNBA New Orleans traded their pick to Philly for 2014. I thought you couldn't trade your first round pick 2 years in a row?
@WindhorstESPN Hope it's like, Top 25 protected
@ByDavidMurphy I agree. Last year was the time to trade, when there were no other  aces at the deadline. As usual, RAJ missed the sweet spot
@andyblarsen @docktora But who have they given records to? Cavs traded with Bucks, that's all I've heard definitively.
@NK975 Disagree man. The history on navicular bones makes me throw up in my mouth.
@ByDavidMurphy Are you trying to tell me that someone got the best of RAJ in a trade?
@jonmorosi Doesn't hurt that James Shields is pitching like an asshole right now
I am super excited for the NBA draft tomorrow night. #SportsNerd
@STANRZ Don't wanna move past three. But I also think worse comes to worse, they take Orl or Utah offer last minute, then snatch Embiid.
@STANRZ I think Orlando &amp; Utah deals are more attractive. I actually think they are holding out because they want Wiggins, Parker, or Exum.
@STANRZ I don't think 3 &amp; Thad does it. MCW for 7 is. Smart/Randle not lasting till 10. I wouldn't mind Exum/Staskus/Randle/Noel next year.
@ESPNSteinLine @DJJazzyJody @1280Spence damn they are gutting their team for Parker
Everyone says society is getting worse, but there are barely any serial killers anymore. That has to account for something.
@NK975 depends. like that dude from DE said, if he thinks Wiggins turns into a superstar, then trading up for him is priority #1.
@NK975 Only concern is it's not a mere 4-6 week break. More like 4-6 months. You have to sit him the whole year to allow bone to heal.
@NK975 I really loved the logic you were demonstrating with Embiid last night. I'd gamble on a franchise player too.
Ok. Now, I would trade #3 &amp; #10 to get Andrew Wiggins. What a difference a day makes.
@WojYahooNBA So he had a fracture in his foot and didn't know it?
"Polyester pleats, you fuckin' jackass"
@BillSimmons I don't think Lebron wants his legacy to be as a career mercenary.
@Buster_ESPN Boy, Detroit really lets their pitchers wither and die on the mound this year .
Starting to get pretty worried the @Sixers are gonna make a really dumb draft night trade to get Andrew Wiggins.

@ByDavidMurphy Probably Buehrle. Generally, no team is dumb enough to sign an "ace-like" contract then immediately suck next 5 years.
@ByDavidMurphy Easily the Dodgers trade. After that.....Vernon Wells a few years ago to LAA?

@STANRZ @ToddZolecki I don't wanna spend big $$$ right now and waste a guy's prime. To me, that wouldn't make sense. But who knows.
@STANRZ @ToddZolecki I would too. I just don't think RAJ does. And I wouldn't spend any $$$ this off season. I think the FA bats are awful.
@STANRZ @ToddZolecki And I don't think they add a big time FA anytime soon. Flesh out minors, see what you have in year or 2, then spend $$$
@STANRZ @ToddZolecki I think new GM looks into Cole trades in off season. It would be RAJ admitting ultimate failure if he traded Hamels.
@STANRZ @ToddZolecki Yeah, but lean years ahead. I don't wanna bank on him being ace caliber at age 33 or 34 when we contend again.
@STANRZ @ToddZolecki I remember agreeing with u on Cole/Tex. I'd try to deal him to NYY or a big market team; don't think they do it though
@ToddZolecki Is this dollar for dollar the worst team ever? I'm sure someone has done an article like this before?

@Hilary_Weissman Oh gosh, please don't, that was just a joke! Eat a healthy cereal prior, and take like, ten good minutes to stretch.
@shwamusic If you want me to say something nice about RAJ, I guess the Chan Ho Park signing was a pleasant surprise.
@shwamusic They have talent, they just don't throw strikes. If your development sucks, it's on the GM to change it.
@shwamusic Regardless of how you feel about Papelbon, not waiting a few more days was so dumb. So, under a microscope, he kind of sucks.
@shwamusic And then he would've waited like, 5 more days to sign Papelbon, they wouldn't have lost their 1st rd pick that year.
@shwamusic And you can't ignore that he basically has never been able to sign a quality middle reliever or bench bat.
@shwamusic So they traded a boat load to get him, then traded him a year later for junk.
@shwamusic The Pence trade is doubly bad because they decided a year later he wasn't the defensive player they thought he was.
@shwamusic It's also why I never bought the argument that they regressed every year since he took over. GM can't help it if they lose in WS.
@shwamusic Same. A GM's job is to build a team good enough to make playoffs. There on out, it's on the players. He did his job that year.
@ryanlawrence21 I hope we take the athletic guy with upside!

@LesBowen @975TheFanatic He's saying Jimmy didn't want know if he wanted to be a "#1, #2, #3 hittter...always changing his mind".

@STANRZ I disagree. This is when teams set their budgets. Trading a big contract in the winter is the time, like Fielder.
@STANRZ I kind of agree with pap. I think you just might have to wait a while to trade him. Make the commitment a bit easier to swallow
@STANRZ I don't think they should spend right now. But waiting to trade Lee, you just give age more time to catch up to him.
@STANRZ he'll wait till Lee starts declining, has a 4 ERA or so, then we'll hear whispers that they're willing to trade Lee. I guarantee it.
@STANRZ Even if he could....you do it after last season. Not when his bat looks completely dead. RAJ operates with a lack of prescience.

@magelb Exactly. Especially when you aren't good enough to compete the next few years and have no young talent.

Just the fact that the Phillies would consider trading Lee or Hamels is music to my ears. #philliestalk

@philliesnation proof we are stuck with this current team for next 2-3 years till the deals expire.
The Best Man Holiday is a sequel to a modestly successful 14 year old film??
Which means that RAJ announces an awful signing of somebody like Ricky Nolasco to a 5 year deal this afternoon.
Not even outraged about the phillies anymore....just hope they are smart enough to go about things the right way.
Phillies have really turned into the Mets circa 2010, huh?
Taking options into account. Rollins, Papelbon, Byrd expire in 2 years. Howard, Utley, Lee, Ruiz in 3 years. This is the team.
Phillies aren't signing any big FA's this year or next. Ruiz &amp; Byrd signings show they are stuck with core for next three years and know it

@STANRZ Like, everyone trash talks. Is 1 sensitive dude gonna sue the NFL because McCoy called him a bad name? Is that now work harassment?
@STANRZ I think adults need to stand up for themselves.
Also don't like where this is going for sports. Different scenarios.
I'll reserve my sympathies for those bullied (i.e. children) who can't defend themselves, not the adults who CHOOSE not to stand up.
@JeffPassan 2 years for Mike Adams was a disaster, so let's fix it by going 3 for the next guy? My favorite team is so dumb.

@ryanlawrence21 By that logic, let's get Papelbon to build a new house in Detroit. The Tigers will HAVE to accommodate a trade now!!!
@ryanlawrence21 I love how his new home has ANYTHING to do with a prospective trade.

@ryanlawrence21 I can hear RAJ already. "Got their feet wet in the field in 2013. We think they are primed to make a huge leap defensively"
@ryanlawrence21 @stephdig @BrianKennyShow My biggest fear is that they resign Utley, Chooch, Doc, &amp; sell it as "One more run in 2014!"
@ryanlawrence21 @stephdig @BrianKennyShow I agree. But even with his production, this is a team going nowhere. I'm just a vote 4 change guy.
@ryanlawrence21 @stephdig @BrianKennyShow I realize that sounds a bit dramatic. Love Chase, but this team is mediocre enough with him.
@ryanlawrence21 @stephdig @BrianKennyShow I just don't think it's fun to watch the decaying carcass of the 2008-2011 teams anymore.
@ryanlawrence21 Leave it. Some teams are in a position to sign 35 year old injury risks to 3 year deals. They aren't.
@ToddZolecki If Asche is at third, I don't see how they can add another lefty.

@ryanlawrence21 At least we got the nightly dumb ass play over by the 5th tonight.
@Tim_McManus he's completely right, and at the same time, I wonder if he is self aware of his actions from the off season.
@shwamusic But they are gonna resign Utley, then Ruiz &amp; Halladay to one year deals, and sell it as "One last run.....again".
@shwamusic And Chooch isn't even good defensively this year. Paying him 5 million next year wouldn't be a win at all.
@shwamusic They won't give them qualifying offers. They would take them because it would make them both ridiculously overpaid.
Actually, I do believe Phillies ownership is making Amaro keep all these guys. If they can't compete, at least sell the fans nostalgia.
If @JonHeymanCBS 's article on Yankees pursuit of M. Young &amp; Chooch is accurate, then the Phillies are indeed run by a mongoloid.
@ByDavidMurphy no one wanted to listen to me when I tried to explain they can't buy a top hitter this winter, even if they had $$$.
@jcrasnick Which means the Phillies give him a 2 year extension in the off season.....
@FrankWrench and if you aren't contending, seems to make sense to move him while he is still pitching like an ace.
@FrankWrench agreed. But lee is older now. He could start dropping off at any moment. Stops pitching like an ace, then you can't move at all
@FrankWrench When all those guys have no trade value left. Then they are just stuck with a bad farm and old bad contracts, like the Cubs.
@FrankWrench Nah man, not trying to pick a fight at all. I like intelligent discussion. I just worry RAJ decides to sell too late.
@FrankWrench So, like a Top 10 prospect? Those guys don't fetch 35 year old players with $70 million left on their contract.
@FrankWrench he'll also lose his job eventually if he never ends up trading his assets while team is stuck in high prices mediocrity.
@GGarr7 Honestly, they don't make a whole lot of profit right now. They've been investing profits back into payroll.
@GGarr7 Yeah, but they don't want to. Because they don't have that tv deal yet. That is their limit, and I can understand that.
@GGarr7 Luxury tax,but I agree with you. It was a bad trade to make if they still thought of themselves as contenders.
@GGarr7 that would'e added something like, 13 million to this years payroll. Put them over the luxury tax. Or right at it. Couldn't do it.
@GGarr7 He's a terrible GM. Which makes our conversation moot, really....they are kind of screwed as long as he's running things.
@GGarr7 But again, that's Amaro making moves without foresight. Spend $$$ till you run out. We'll figure out the budget after that.
@GGarr7 Well, that was another problem. I get the Vic trade. But they traded Pence because they couldn't afford him this year.
@GGarr7 they will. Both our arguments seem to make no sense to the other. And that's ok....
@GGarr7 I guess we just fundamentally disagree. I say stop gaps haven't worked last two years, why should they start now? You seem to think.
@GGarr7 You can get a good deal for Utley. He is healthy this year, and 2B is a thin position. A contender would love to have Utley.
@GGarr7 I don't need "top". I don't need one of the three best prospects in baseball for Lee. I need a package.
@shwamusic True, but they were a contender then. So it hurt. You have to get something for Lee at this point. Holding him makes no sense.
@GGarr7 Right now they are paying lots of cash for an old team not going anywhere, with a terrible farm system. Not a good scenario.
@GGarr7 Assets fetch prospect returns. Then I have more payroll to spend in 2 years, while building my farm system at the same time.
@GGarr7 Lee is an asset. Utley is an asset because 2B is so bad. Howard is untradeable. Jimmy said it himself he isn't going anywhere.
@GGarr7 I'm not sure I follow. How did that go against everything I said?
@GGarr7 He's 37 and just had major surgery. I think it's fair to assume old Doc isn't ever coming back. If he can pitch again, great.
@GGarr7 Sooner Amaro comes to the realization that you can't lean on the core to be the backbone of your team, the better.
@GGarr7 They are role players at this point. But the team continues to act like they're bad ass hitters. They aren't anymore.
@GGarr7 I'm really not trying to be negative, I just don't see a quick fix. And if there is no quick fix, you have to trade your assets.
@GGarr7 I do agree with you that its a crapshoot. But they are running in place right now. Howard, JRoll, Utley, Doc ain't getting better.
@GGarr7 They are old. Old guys get injured. It's not bad luck...it's poor planning. It will continue to happen as long as they remain old.
@GGarr7 I completely agree you can't change a whole team in 1 season. Trade Lee to be a beast in 3 seasons. Not just continue to be .500
@GGarr7 But that's my point. You are saying that could contend next year. I'm saying they can't. I want a GM who operates with foresight.
@GGarr7 Not doom and gloom. I actually laid out a realistic, thought out scenario as to why they can't win in next year or two.
@GGarr7 Exactly. Which is why you trade assets that people want for flexibility. This team is mediocre as hell. Why keep it together?
@GGarr7 And you can't keep Lee, hoping for him to be an ace in 2015, the season he turns 37. Makes no sense.
@GGarr7 They are in such a ridiculously bad spot man. They can't contend next year.
@GGarr7 You can add the best pieces because it would be insane to have an all lefty line up. So they can't even get the best options.
@GGarr7 Meaning, they are just gonna keep the same old guys around one more year, trying to will it to work. Which will lead to mediocrity.
@GGarr7 Free agency isn't what it used to be. Can't just buy their way out this mess. And that cash 2-3 seasons away.
@GGarr7 it doesn't work because literally your entire line up, other than Jroll, is LH. You don't have prospects to trade for impact bat.
@GGarr7 Bullpen you can do. All the best FA's are LH. If you keep Asche at 3rd, and splurge on Ellsbury &amp; McCann, for instance....
@GGarr7 How could they possibly contend? Putting duct tape on this team in off season hasn't worked lately. How do they do it this winter?
@GGarr7 Not moving up from Lee &amp; Utley, while they won't contend next year is such a terrible mistake. It's Amaro's worst sin as a GM.
@GGarr7 Teams don't trade a top 5 prospect for old players with $70 million on their deals. No matter how good. You have to be realistic.
@ALLsportsINTEL Are you a Phillies fan?
@GGarr7 Nah man, respectfully disagree. They won't win a WS in next two or three years. Need good young players in worst way.
@ALLsportsINTEL It's probably smarter to trade Lee in offseason. But resigning Utley makes no sense, I'll agree with you there.
Players aren't on the market to be able to buy themselves out of the mess they've created. $$$ from tv deal is irrelevant. #Philliestalk
Phillies are going to turn into the Chicago Cubs because they are absolutely afraid to move on. #Philliestalk
Seems as if RAJ is operating out of fear, now, instead of long term prospects of team. Afraid to move on, afraid to mess up  Lee trade twice
@ALLsportsINTEL But if you advocate them eating cash to get good prospects, in theory, they should be able to trade him almost anywhere.
With Cliff Lee having nowhere to get traded, I'm now very eager to see how RAJ fucks up the rest of the trade deadline. #Philliestalk
@ByDavidMurphy Maybe in the next 10 years or so, they'll hit on one of those "toolsy athletes"
@Ken_Rosenthal Phillies fan who totally agrees with you over Harold. I'm worried they turn into the Cubs if they don't trade some assets
@ScottMCBS @Buster_ESPN My favorite are these people respond to GM rhetoric like they should be taken literally.
Ruben Amaro Jr. looking a little less smug these days.....
@ByDavidMurphy their inability to say "thank you for your service" is going to cost a lot of people their jobs in the long run.
If Amaro trades Cliff Lee to a desperate team for a load of prospects at the trade deadline, then he is a genius. #philliestalk
The main problem with the issue of GQ with Drake on the cover is that most people who read GQ couldn't give any less of a shit about Drake.
@ByDavidMurphy you really can't justify more than one year. Utley gets injured again, and everyone would want RAJ's head in a noose.
@jaysonst @_Philly_Talk Only way RAJ's tenure goes is being stubborn, refusing to sell, patchwork team in off season, .500 again, RAJ fired

@AaronRodgers12 I am sorry Braun ended up making you look like a wiener.
@Ken_Rosenthal You know what sucks? He really questioned the testers character last year after hearing. That was pretty low.
Cliff Lee serving up home runs like they're on a dollar menu the last few games.
@STANRZ not as good as CBP. It has a very "enclosed" feel. Still pretty nice though. Hope we can finally get to Harvey.
I'm at the Phillies game at Citifield today. Cliff Lee vs. Matt Harvey!
@MasoneDylan Some kid ran on the field in Philly, and his college acceptance got revoked. Hope this doesn't happen to you.
Don't like to read trade deadline blogs anymore, because they all seem to make note of how poorly RAJ is running the Phils. #philliestalk

RT @JukeLeft: Panicked architect warns that Mets stadium not designed to hold so much talent http://t.co/AxKI2nfHcM
If RAJ sells, he can buy time by rolling out a fresh, young team. If he buys, it's a .500 ball club next two seasons, and then gets canned.
Trade deadline is fascinating this year. If RAJ doesn't sell (including Lee), it's pretty much a given he'll be fired after the 2014 season.

@STANRZ It's better than picking up complimentary pieces like Nick Young and Kwame Brown instead. Built to go for it in next two years.
@STANRZ I think that was a good move. He's already locked into DWill, JJ, &amp; Lopez. If owner willing to pay luxury tax...
@magelb In all fairness, at least it looks like they give a shit.

@BobCooney76 That is a good trade then. I like the move.

@STANRZ @ryanlawrence21 I think biggest criticism one can make of Charlie is that he didn't preach fundamentals when "core" was at its peak.

No Phillies have any capabilities of reading a ball off the bat.

It really is true, isn't it? Ryan Howard's problem isn't a  #5 hitter anymore. They throw him mostly strikes. He just can't lay off balls

@magelb I don't understand how one of the older teams in MLB has me asking "What the hell were they thinking???" virtually every game.
Matt Gelb is reporting that was the 1st 0-2 pitch Ryan Howard homered on since 2008. That's why he makes the big bucks.

@JmitchInquirer True. But some are a tier below, where they can get a team to playoffs year in, year out. He doesn't  even do that.
@JmitchInquirer Plus, his teams don't do anything. Last year was his 1st playoff year since rookie year. So he isn't really a game changer.
@JmitchInquirer I agree. But you then are a marginally better team (7 seed?) that just blew all its cap room.

It's officially the creepiest day of the year....Ash Wednesday, where you have to pretend everyone looks normal.
Michael Vick can do one of those six things. #Eaglestalk #GreatNews #Sarcasm
In Chip Kelly's system, a QB needs to: Be mobile, protect the ball, protect himself, avoid sacks, be able to read a D &amp; make quick decisions
Jack White is arguably the weirdest looking dude in the planet, but he is also easily the best songwriter on the planet as well.
Someone should tell Bucks County Residents that 3" of snow isn't all that crippling.
The best part about all the Felix Hernandez articles is I get to relive Ryan Howard's ridiculous contract over and over again!
I think drinking vodka tonics and listening to The National go hand-in-hand.
@Buster_ESPN Great article, Buster. Spot on.
@ESPNSteinLine Do GM's go "I've seen 10 years of Dalembert &amp; wasn't impressed, but that one awesome game last night swayed my mind!" ?
So Ryan Braun is the new Lance Armstrong?
I hate when you KNOW someone had plastic surgery, but you aren't entirely sure what they got done...and you can't just ask them.
"Have you ever transcended space &amp; time?"  "Yes. Ehh, no....time, but not space. I don't know what you're asking me."
If I have to listen to Ray Lewis talk about "God's Will" one more time.....
RT @MikeDrucker: Even worse, the electric fence that keeps out the T. Rex is down.
At least the Black Eyed Peas a few years ago were entertainingly God awful. Beyonce's performance is just boring.
Super Bowl commercials make me think advertisers think America has the lowest common denominator type sense of humor.
Ray Lewis is the most annoying man on the planet.
I don't condone what Hitler did, but his biggest mistake was targeting the Jews instead of people with "outie" belly buttons.
Women who are super obsessed &amp; hoping on getting snow need to clean the cobwebs out of their vagina's.

@bluthquotes 9/11 certainly didn't help.
It was already way hot at the gym tonight, and it certainly steamed up more once I got there.#cocky
Can't even imagine how awkward life would be if they had yoga pants when I was in jr. high. #boners

It feels downright tropical today.
@LesBowen That seems like an unnecessarily mean thing to say about someone.
@JenniferPaone I wish people would just splurge more often and use condoms.
LeSean McCoy kind of sounds like a scumbag. And are his followers just lepers without a brain?
"Girls NEVER say anything without there being some sort of  meaning behind it. They don't think any other way". Sagest advice ever.
My dad spent 10 mins telling me about make up tips he saw on Anderson Cooper's show today. No idea why he was so fascinated.
@JmitchInquirer He's odd; you have to cater to him to get the best out of him, but he's not a good enough player to cater to. Catch 22
If I could decipher seemingly innocuous messages from girls as to what they are really saying, I could market that and be a billionaire.
Laying the ground work......
@SixersCEOAdam They got tight at the end of the game.
On the news, detectives said a body found burning in a basement with its hands tied behind its back seemed "suspicious". Good work guys!

The Museum of Sex in New York is not for the faint of heart.
Stan Muscial was my cousins uncle. Super nice man the time I met him. One of the old time greats. #Stl
Chicks next to me are attempting to answer the question "how many pictures can one take of themselves on an hour train ride"?
@SI_PeterKing when are we going to talk the elephant in the room, which is the lack of white corner backs????
Nothing says "lets honor the victims of the Colorado Theater Massacre" like a viewing of "The Hobbit".
"Jesus, if my fiancée ever reads my texts, she's going to think I'm setting up a gay rendezvous."
"She's out of town tonight, come up to New York, we'll have the place to ourselves...."
@GeoffMosherCSN This might be a really stupid question, but could teams "trade" defensive coordinators if they so desired?
RT @robdelaney: How crazy is it that there are dudes who get off sucking women’s toes? Yikes! If you’re a woman who’d let a guy do that  ...
@AdamSchefter The real tragedy of the league is the lack of white cornerbacks. They are there dammit, we just aren't finding them!!!!
Excited to see Zero Dark Thirty tonight....at this rate, I'll be presenting an Oscar.
Just once, even though they are highly entertaining, I'd like to see Chuck Klosterman do an article without using a hypothetical question.
@gonzoCSN I thought that was exactly why he didn't want police involved at all.
RT @gonzoCSN: Te’o wants us to believe the girl he loved had leukemia, got in a car accident &amp; died. &amp; yet he never went to see  ...
@gonzoCSN He makes me look like a gem of a boyfriend in comparison, so I'm happy!
Maybe only if you're socially inept, but what kind of 22 year old football player has an online only girlfriend halfway across the country?
If Manti Te'o was really just duped, he was a REALLY shitty boyfriend.
So, in the next 48 hours, do we get a press conference where Manti Te'o becomes the 1st openly gay athlete in a major sport? #FakeGirlfriend
RT @michaelianblack: Making up a dead girlfriend is the new coming out of the closet.
Maybe I'm just being obnoxious, but I don't understand why grossly overweight people use ab machines. #trimthefatfirst
RT @kaitlin_olson: Chip! Chip! Chipadelphia!!!!!!!!!!
@DonBanks It's a reverse Billy Donovan.
I have no idea if Chip Kelly will be a good coach, just like I have no idea about Gus Bradley...but this will be a fascinating story.
@jonahkeri @mortreport As an Eagles fan, my fear was that he'd take the Eagles job, then pull a Billy Donovan. He just did the reverse.
I think the album art for David Bowie's "The Next Day" is one of the most brilliant album covers I've seen in a long time.
If the Sixers had a promotion where they gave away Big Macs every time the OPPONENT scored 100, McDonalds would go out of business.
I'm normally not a violent man, but the Sixers need to be executed for the effort they have given tonight. #sixerstalk
@SixersCEOAdam And Kwame doesn't even play at all. We really did a poor job with our acquisitions last off season.
Do you ever look up peeps who share your name on facebook &amp; think "If I go around the country &amp; kill all these people, I can live forever"?
@SixersCEOAdam Most disappointing part of team is JRich/NYoung/DWright. Neither guy has distinguished himself. Too many guys, too few mins?
Dad (today): "I just bought a new car"
Dad (yesterday): "Buying a car in the dead of winter is stupid. I am waiting until spring to buy a new car."
Ryan Howard's contract hangs off the Phillies like an anchor you can't break free from.
Hate to say it, but the Nationals are now better than the Phillies in every single way.
Django Unchained was pretty solid, though too long. Leonardo Dicaprio &amp; Christoph Waltz were fantasic, Jamie Foxx....not so much.
@daldridgetnt You get very passive aggressive with the corrections.
And seriously, if you turn on your phone for more than 15 seconds during a movie, there is a special spot in hell already reserved for you.
Stop checking e-mail, facebook &amp; twitter every few mins. Unless you're a surgeon or firefighter, everything can wait. Live in the moment.
My facebook pet peeve is when couples have the same profile pic. Makes things very confusing.
Still need to check out "Django Unchained", "Zero Dark Thirty", "Lincoln", &amp; "Beasts of the Southern Wild" before Oscar night.
Oscar Best Pic Update: Scene "Life of Pi", "Argo", &amp; "Silver Linings Playbook". Pretty sure I won't see "Les Mis" or "Amour".
If you've seen the film, you know what I mean when you get the feeling Affleck wants to say "Argo fuck yourself" to the Oscars.
@petertebow God gave Tim the looks, the athletic skills, &amp; charm. He gave you the wit for snarky tweets. #Somebodygotscrewed
@JeffPassan As an Eagles fan, I am amused at how many Andy Reid jokes popped up on twitter right after that play.
Parking lot in from of the Linc now. So weird. http://t.co/WQJdpELy
