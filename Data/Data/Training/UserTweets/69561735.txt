Life is two dimensions in nature. Time has come to become more extravagant,  no matter what and how people think, after all it's your life.
Do something that surprise your near and dear ones, no matter what,  your actions should raise curiosity on how you did it rather than why.
I still believe that there is a divine force that controls us, our lives, this earth, this world and this infinite universe.
