@PhillyD I mean Shay Carl is huge, but I am always interested in your view on whatever @realDonaldTrump et al has going on.
@FakeShay1 interesting theory- maybe could apply to family but not coworkers or brand managers. I will hold onto 1% chance u r right.
@FakeShay1 me? Yes.but many family members/coworkers managers could speak out for him. Shay is brand worth protecting&amp;would if it was fake.
@FakeShay1 the BIGGEST piece of proof isn't from the cam girl but from the silence from the Shay Camp. If it was fake some1 would speak out.
@MrBigNoodle sure- change your statement. S'all good for you. Enjoy life sir.
@MrBigNoodle the ONLY reason I tweeted you was for the numbers and hyperbole- we agreed on the conclusion.
@MrBigNoodle we already argued this at like 3amEST. Your article cited dubious studies and your math/assumptions debunked.
@MrBigNoodle @TheObsiidian ah yes, the "I was wrong with my facts so I will just insult my opponents" defense. Classic.

@GreenTheOnlyWay @KEEMSTAR @_ShaycarI TBF K has only said shay confirmed,  but why would K lie? Fake tweets possible but didn't happen here.
@GreenTheOnlyWay @SareeSwob @shaycarl let's not jump to those conclusions. Otherwise every1 will say he's been with any female YT collab

@NiniTrin Jesus wanted people 2b nice to one another. I can get behind that. I am happy &amp; hope others find same happiness their own way.
@_ShaycarI I so want this situation to be fake &amp; a poorly timed admittance of relapsed alcoholism. But alas and alack...
@NiniTrin I try to not judge any religion/group on the actions of individual members but on its works as a whole. Indie People fail, a lot.
Notice: once u make a bad choice u can never be forgiven. Just stay as awful as u are forever.Stay in your box, don't change your label. /s
@NiniTrin LDS=Mormon, just like shaytards. It's how I found them on YT.
@NiniTrin and us LDS girls can leave a marriage lickety split if we so desire.
@NiniTrin I am LDS maybe I see it a different way. Shay should NOT have called the girl disgusting &amp; NOT have cheated. But cest la vie. :(
@NiniTrin I can only hope all involved get the help they need- not shay alone.
@NiniTrin I agree probably not isolated, but only speculations at this point. Fans only saw highly edited 10-20 minutes/week of their lives.
@NiniTrin I thought they were Rubio fans (not that he is any better) haven't paid attn to older gen in long time though.
@NiniTrin oh what shay did was deplorable- from all angles. Just trying to connect dots to y whole family must support that cheeto?
@NiniTrin you're blasting the religion then? for a moment I thought you meant sexting a cam girl meant you had to support Trump.
@NiniTrin @shaycarl @katilette wait wha?
https://t.co/X40fOceRmo. &lt;- what a proper study looks like. Notice it is NOT a clickbaity easy to read list article. #thinkcritically
That math @MrBigNoodle still assumes evry1 must cheat &amp; the studies just haven't caught them yet. Proper studies take years for a reason.
@MrBigNoodle I will agree to the dubious studies. the 78% was from personal interviews of article author but agree cheating is probably 3/4.
@MrBigNoodle u didn't show study. Ur cited article linked studies that estimate 78% of partners had affairs. U jumped to 99% on ur own.
Ah yes, I forgot that truth and hope are verboten on twitter, only hyperbole and rage is allowed. Sorry @MrBigNoodle gnight
@MrBigNoodle sext=\=flirt. Being friendly is often considered flirting. And again to say *everyone* is a bold and factually incorrect claim.
@MrBigNoodle next tweet said everyone will at least sext someone else. I don't think he is monster; I think he has mental prob &amp;addictions
@MrBigNoodle while cheating/sexting/etc is rampant- to say everyone will do it at some point is a bold claim.

DJ guy is forcing his minions to eat their snacks- even if  they don't like it. What if this blue cat is lactose intolerant DJ!?
potato bug on a skateboard is a great work of art according to #yogabbagabba Charlie loves this show a little too much!
#frodo is teaching Charlie how to do a puppet dance. it's terrifying. His eyes are staring into my soul...
in case you don't know- this is the first episode I've ever watched #yogabbagabba
#ironic that a robot is teaching kids how to brush their teeth. #dangitsacatchysong #yogabbagabba
So...is the DJ guy the gabba's god? Is that how it works? #yogabbagabba
#thingsilearnedfromyogabbagabba dogs can teach long division if you're nice to them. Mice also hang out with starfish. underwater. #wtf
Charlie only loves it because they sing 99% of the time. Clearly they are hypnotizing our youth with the devil music. #facts
There is a green alien thing, TALKING to his food, and it's talking back. And there's a party in his tummy. #yogabbagabba #wtf #kidshows

@decoolz she loves books, dora and my little pony, but really this is the kid who was entertained by a sock for an hour yesterday.
creepy, after luke conard's joke with joey...I'm trying out couple names for luke/ingrid. I have #lungrid #ingke #lukgrid .../creeper mode
Hey @JoeyGraceffa! @LukeConard told me to tell you that you're going to ROCK during your interview with @taylorswift13 today!
I dyed rice, pasta, candy and my fingers today in preparation for baby's 2nd birthday party. #rainbowhands
@decoolz my tweet limit from last year rolled over to 2012. #facts
I love watching Charlie skype with my mom, she keeps trying to pet the kitty through the screen. #cutekid #skype
I seriously have 13 more mins of this? okay. I'll just wait for the morning news recap of the commercials I miss. G'night #superbowl
FERRIS COMMERCIAL is the best. you win. end game.
white chocolate peanut butter is my downfall. why must it be delicious on EVERYTHING?
@decoolz you can't fight crime with a BABY time machine. that's insane. but you can enjoy improv comedy shows :)
@decoolz everyday could be a tuesday summer. #lifedreams
@decoolz also the first thing I thought was "we could harass john herman again!" #neverlefthighschool
@decoolz but I don't want to have my mom fall in love with me... that'd be awkward.
oh, nevermind, they had a "sequel" to the beer commercial. #lame
are...are we already repeating superbowl commercials? really?
@decoolz with the time machine we could try to find the time lord. but back to the future is good too.
protip: make your own hashtags and you'll be the most popular in the search.
@decoolz, we could LIVE Dr.Who. #babyisatimemachine
so far they have killed christina and now john??
excuse me, time to go check my kid for a time machine.
time machine non-pooping baby??
BABY AT SUPERBOWL. Adorable, but needs to go to bed soon!
the guy passed/kicked/dropped the ball. #accurate
@decoolz true, the spam bots may actually care about my procreation habits a little more, they could sell that info to Ads
YES. #TVMUSICALS I will definitely watch #Smash
#wannabepregnant #itisawholefertilitything #TMI #sorry #nofriends
also I just ate two whole stalks of broccoli. #weirdcravings #notpregnant
I have nothing to mock while the game is going because I can't do puns when I don't know anything. #superbowl
umm...can we do the halftime over again? the game is boring. #superbowl
RT @OnionSports: NFL: "Madonna's message of 'world peace' does not reflect the views of the National Football League"
@decoolz you will be internet famous for killing madonna.
@fairyxo send me some snow- we haven't had even a dusting all winter!
guys, @decoolz killed #madonna.
@realjohngreen asking for world peace is bold? I'm all for it, and promoting it, and striving for it but bold?
#decoolz she stopped singing just because you watched.
did...did they just kill christina? #worldpeace
my overall review: 7/10 can't go wrong with classic madonna songs, but nothing SUPER amazing or mind blowing.
performing in a 360 stage has gotta be hard. #randomthoughts
also impressed with madonna's costumes. tasteful but still kick@$$ #madonna #halftime
whoa, the stadium just imploded. #halftime
okay, loving the drumline. that is pretty sweet. #halftime
@sportswithjohn  you just like cheerleader madonna. ;)
so...roman centurions and Egyptian cheerleaders. seems legit.
@decoolz she's just walking and jumping a little, my grandma has more moves at 70!
little disappointed in her dancing, the background peeps are great though. #madonna #halftime
I'm waiting for sue from #glee to come in and sing this song. #superbowl
wait..robot angels?! #love
liking the theme already.. #madonna #halftime
I think @sportswithjohn is getting drowsy on his cold meds, lack of his sparkly john wit in the tweets. #feelbetter
charlie went to bed cuddling her mini-lightsaber and reading her eric carle books. #geekmom #geekbaby #proudgeeks
(just realized I treat twitter as a giant AIM chatroom. with character limits.)
okay, bedtime stories before #madonna comes out. BE RIGHT BACK. DON'T MISS ME
'cuse me, my kid is eating trash. pause the #livetweet ramblings.
now I remember why I don't come on twitter. All my "followers" are really empty spam bots. #foreveralone
err.. that is 00:00:29. &gt;.&gt; twenty nine minutes normally takes a half hour....
NFL: where 0:29 can take a half hour.
she's turning 2 in 9 days. TWO. she's practically grown up.
etrade baby has always been one of my faves, Charlie looked a lot like him when she was itty bitty.
slingshot baby was pretty adorable, but that kid shouldn't eat doritos.
if the #patriots lose, my facebook feed is going to be depressing for WEEKS.
listen, I'm done with football. bring on the #halftime show and #madonna. kthnxbai.
@sportswithjohn I was appalled at that video! how could they think that was a good idea?!
after the kid's bedtime I can bring out the good snacks I don't want to share...
thanks for the nightmares http://t.co/5Mwx1E8X. #neversleepingagain
things the superbowl teaches guys; give a girl flowers and she'll put out for you. #goodvalues
trend of 2012 commercials: END OF THE WORLD! either by mayan calendars running out or superheroes FAILING.
wait, high school musical has been trending since i joined twitter almost 3 years ago.
no streakers in this game. high school football is 20% cooler. #superbowl
STAR WARS. I like it
car are not skateboards. #physics
I search john green on pinterest and I see a bunch of green rooms. #nerdfighters #johngreen
extreme lack of #nerdfighters on pinterest. where my dftba-ers at?! #cantpulloffgangsta
@decoolz thankfully I'm alone w/charlie so no one can mock me. but then no one yells at a good play so I am lost during the game part.
@decoolz I knew the pats were in it. my facebook feed wouldn't let me NOT know that. but other than Brady, I don't know any other player.
in vloggy news, anyone interested in watching a chapter by chapter book review of the harry potter series? I want to re-read it anyways.
I vote we stop the #superbowl and just put on #thelorax movie right now. agreed?
I don't know the score or the players. heck if @realjohngreen didn't live in the city I wouldn't know that either!
charlie is mad that my computer isn't touchscreen like at the library. she just rolled her eyes. #teenagedtoddler
before I click it- any guesses why hungry hungry hippos is trending atm? #oddtrends
it was inception- a commercial within commercial! #superbowl #starwars #volkswagon

LORAX LORAX LORAX MOVIE #CHILDHOODDREAMS #SUPERBOWL
I just got dora thrown at me. think I need to pay attention to the toddler? bedtime countdown: 49 minutes!
@fairyxo basically, its a worldwide celebration for nachos. #nachoday
@fairyxo it's trending worldwide, we got ex-pats all over and people just like a day to party for no reason
I'm thinking the #superbowl is not for mormons #antialcohol
how am I supposed to tell the teams apart when they wear the same colors? I get it, red white and blue is HOT this year. #timgunnisproud
DEAD CATS SELL CHIPS. #superbowl
oh yes, whoo-hoo beer is sooo awesome. Let's forget all the bad decision people make while drinking it. #superbowlads
dead kids, selling stuff since 2012. D: #sad #crying #hormonal #shut #up
WHY DOES THE END OF THE WORLD ALWAYS HAPPEN WHEN A LITTLE KID IS IN THE CAR?! #superbowl
pretty sure godaddy is just porn that also sells domain names....#superbowl
I heard you like football, so I put a football in your football so you can football while you football #superbowl
@redhairedflame  yeah, a brand new trailer apparently premiered in the pre-game? I'm looking for it on youtube but no luck.
okay, so while the boring sport even goes on- who saw the newest my little pony? #rainbowdash #daringdo #superbowl
end of the world, only chevy truck drivers will survive? #rainingfrogs #2012killsusall #hashtagjumble
THIS IS MOST DEPRESSING COMMERCIAL EVER. #CRIES
okay, that words with friends on the airplane bit was funny well done #superbowl well done
aaand found out I missed it? stupid #parenting getting the way of my fun.
waiting for the #hungergames ad in the #superbowl. and nachos. #firstthingsfirst
@decoolz we should get JKRowling to put on a quidditch match for the next #superbowl :)
#pepsi got great costumes, weird premise #superbowlads
did you know you can get #superbowl rings made? Why go through the trouble of playing for the NFL? ;)
ewww beer. #mormon #superbowl
guys, the wheels went ROUND AND ROUND. #wheelsonbus2012
maybe I should livetweet wheels on the bus with Charlie #dramaticnoises
okay, now that the game has started, i can go get food and parent my child #priorities
pretty cute car commercial that doesn't make me want to buy a car #superbowl
this is why muggle sports are boring- no divination or anything #quidditchworldcup
that guy looks pissed that his captain didn't predict the future. #superbowl #sportsfan
whoo I win the #superbowl
my guess: heads. #superbowl
@decoolz yes, yes I am. because I won't be live tweeting the actual GAME
Charlie keeps asking when they will catch the ball #superbowl #bigquestions
heck yeah Ronald McDonald houses! great charity- srsly, check them out. #superbowl
no great commercials yet. sad. #superbowl
niiice Kelly. great song, no need to add all that ooohoooooaahhh stuff most others do. #awesome # Super Bowl
kelly is doing much better. though let us see if she goes crazy at the end with voice trembles #superbowl
love the patriotic attitude of this song, but their voices don't blend so well #superbowl #livetweet

@awwwry I don't have it, I've cleared browsing history, rebooted, checked different computers- none show anything,
@highof75 my default is chrome, i tried IE and safari, and just downloaded firefox to try that. #obsessed much?
#pottermore doesn't want me to sleep. tried three browsers, none of them worked. I'll be back tomorrow I guess.
@pottermore IE Google Chrome and Safari on three different computers- all no ad or feather. I have nothing installed to block it. what's up?
@pottermore google chrome seems to be incompatible with today's clue, I have no ad-block installed and yet, nothing on the answer's page?
@mahroman, thanks it it just loops back to pottermore.com

@decoolz and isn't #deathlyhallows the one where hermione gets a boob-job (this is michael's idea)
@Decoolz I heard it was supposed to be 9 but the rating got too risque.
@Decoolz neville has always been a BAMF. Word.

my #nanowrimo story is a sick cross of babysitter's club and desperate housewives. #weird
@Decoolz with my insane schedule I was praying for a 500 word short story. Yay I won. At 2558 right now.
@Realjohngreen I'd hope you would remember making a video on such an interesting and important topic like lemming suicides.
