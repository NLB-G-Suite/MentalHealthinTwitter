Is there a plan for new jobs for those losing livelihood once the likes of Walmart start connecting smartly with farmers and consumers?
Should our government surrender to that one foreign entity depriving job opportunities for millions of middlemen?
Yes, one big foreign multinational company may have the financial resource which our millions of middlemen put together could not match.
There should be implementation of laws that prohibit middlemen from black marketing rather than eliminating all middlemen.
The aim of directly connecting farmers with consumers should be through better allocation of existing national resource in a gradual manner.
Little point in a reform cutting price of mass consumption items by 50% (pro consumer) if the same creates unemployment for say 2% populace.
Terms like greater efficiency not always in the best overall national interest.
In US, stimulus package is often about creating jobs by artificial means like digging wells and then filling as it would create employment.
If the government is willing to improve distribution channel, it is most welcome, but not by creating unemployment situation for millions.
Often, no thin line of distinction between consumers, farmers, middlemen.Farmers and middlemen too are consumers.
It is good if farmers paid more for their farm output. However, middlemen are also a part of the society.
It is argued that farmers would benefit with better price with the elimination of middlemen that allegedly sucks 60 to 80% of retail price.
One reason by the Congress (I) for FDI in retail is that foreign investment would improve distribution channel by eliminating middlemen.
Improve distribution channel by better allocating resource rather than inviting foreigners who would take profit else availed by our people

Accommodation of diverse opinions makes Indian democracy a system of choice.
Plurality tagged with democracy prepares democratic system to accept conflicts and sort them out amicably respecting human rights.
There is a consensus that while everyone has the right to pursue one's religion, one should not have the right to abuse other's religion.
Making distinction between right of freedom to express and expressions that can hurt fellow citizens’ feelings can be tricky.
The idea of pluralism is inherent in Indian democracy.Flexibility to assimilate diverse opinions is what pluralism is all about.
There are rooms for diverse opinions in Indian democratic system and multiple parties exist to represent different ideologies.
