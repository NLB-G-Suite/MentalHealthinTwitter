@bekeli30 Hi, Becky! :)
@Beckyy27 Hi, dear! Do you have any good oriental (arabic, turkish...) dessert recipes? :)
RT @GreatestQuotes: "Plans are only good intentions unless they immediately degenerate into hard work." - Peter Drucker.
@Beckyy27 really? you never change it? wow, you're a hero. I'm a bit ADHD when it comes to workouts :) need variety!!
Dang. I locked the office and the key broke #I_hate_mondays
@Beckyy27 I'm not!! Totally not my type :/
@Beckyy27 Yeah, I suspected that ;))) I just sent you an email describing it, if you're interested - it'd be great to workout together :)
@Beckyy27 btw, do you want to join me in the fitness challenge for this winter?
@Beckyy27 Wish me luck with these rowdy boys :)
@Beckyy27 We're trying to figure out the schedule cause with their trainings and mine we can't seem to have a common free spot.
@Beckyy27 It's gonna be tough ;) My students are 4 guys, 25-35 yo I guess, very much into sports and working out :) And almost zero english!
#fitness #challenge http://t.co/8jQNRQDB Everyone welcome!!
@Beckyy27 sort of. It's more like evening classes for adults :) Just met the group today...4 guys, lol. Gonna be interesting :)
@Beckyy27 Killing time at work for another hour or so, and then I'll head home :) I start teaching English today, btw )))
@Beckyy27 hi, dear! how's life going? anything exciting planned for the weekend? :)
@Beckyy27 Yay! How many left?
Today's agenda: lunch with a good friend! :)
@Beckyy27 Mother's work is never done :) Yeah, the work is ok. The boss is away for 2 weeks, so I'm all alone, working on translation :)
@Beckyy27 A rainy morning isn't so bad when you can stay at home :) And a cuppa tea always makes a working morning better!
@Beckyy27 Good morning, sweetie! Hope it's a beautiful day in Austria today :)
@Beckyy27 how exciting! must be good to visit home :) I'm fine, trying to settle back into routine. Oh, I've also taken up Muay Thai! :)
@Beckyy27 Hi, sweetie! How're you doing? Seems like you went on a trip recently - where to? :)

@Beckyy27 Thank you! Hope you have a good night sleep :-*
@Beckyy27 It's nothing major, just soemthing related to my language studies that could be really helpful :) now you can sleep peacefully :))
@Beckyy27 I wish :((( no, for now traveling isn't on the family budget...:( maybe once I'm done with exams and find a job!! :)
@Beckyy27 Well, being a mother is a job, so maybe that's your true calling ;)
@Beckyy27 ...I'm still waiting fir the confirmation. As soon as I get it, I'll let you know what's going on ;)
@Beckyy27 Yes, it was great! Although I didn't get as much study done, I really enjoyed that lunch with my friends. And as for good news...
@Beckyy27 So, what's that job that you don't want? And which one do you want? :)

Sitting in the car and waiting for relatives with keys from the house...note to self-never give the keys away again! :)
@Beckyy27 And how was yours? :)
@Beckyy27 No, now that we're living with relatives in the cottage, we don't go to church. Can't wait for September to get back there! :)
@Beckyy27 Sounds familiar! :)) i feel the same way with languages - every day another load of stuff to learn...and it never ends! :)
@Beckyy27 hi, Becky! How're you doing? Have you successfully conquered that enormous to-do list of yours? :)

@Beckyy27 ...and we planned to spend the night together at home. Now, though, we'll have to stay at the cottage :)
@Beckyy27 Dunno...probably stay at least overnight cause tomorrow I'm supposed to drive early out of town with a friend...
@Beckyy27 I know the feeling :) I'm okay, packing stuff (dad thinks it's too cold now to stay at the summer house, so they're going home)
@Beckyy27 oh, what's going on, Becky? :)

@Beckyy27 Lol :) and they say that progress is a good thing, haha :)) so much stress for such insignificant things!
@Beckyy27 Yes. Now that you are a second away, the wait for a word from him can become an obsession - why isn't he writing?? Lol
@Beckyy27 At least I got a good workout with all that climbing :))
@Beckyy27 When I went to the sea and had bad connection, I had to climb a mountain to text message to my boyfriend :) the price of love ;)
@Beckyy27 you're welcome! What a romantic story :)

@Beckyy27 yes, exactly. Cause it's quite chilly here right now, around 15C
@Beckyy27 I like it so far. I also sometimes use twittelator on my iPad, cause I'm more familiar with it and the look is clean and simple :)

@Beckyy27 really beautiful! Is it hot there?
#anki on #android is actually fun! :)
@Beckyy27 ugh, math. Never been good are it :) but being a lawyer also isn't fun. Ill have to look into interpreting :)
@Beckyy27 lol, that's so not true :)) and what profession do you have? you probably have already told me, but this poor memory...:)
@Beckyy27 ah, i see. Too bad, you seem to really like Dubai :)
@Beckyy27 why not anymore? :) and i've been with my mom to turkey, and nothing terrible happened ;)
@Beckyy27 btw, have you gotten yourself a job after that  course you did? or doing anything similar? :)
@Beckyy27 Yes, that'd be awesome! We'll definitely do this in future, the question is just how soon :))
@Beckyy27 Turkey and Egypt, lol :)) I'll talk to my parents, since they'll have to be the ones paying ;)
@Beckyy27 ...in most cases one needs a tour from big organization or smth like that :(
@Beckyy27 I'd love to, but we're not in shengen zone, so I heed visas for everything :( and getting them now is really hard...

@Beckyy27 I like it so far. I also sometimes use twittelator on my iPad, cause I'm more familiar with it and the look is clean and simple :)
