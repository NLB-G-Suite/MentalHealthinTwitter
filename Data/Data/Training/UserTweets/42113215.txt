OH MY GOD BOOOOOOOOO
Paul McCartney is still alive, no? Like, he could be doing this?
Was unaware that my uncle was an Oscar voter.
I like that they took the WORST scene in Spotlight to highlight for an acting award.
On the bright side, at least the minions can't give this award to those fucking volcanos from the short before Inside Out.
This, but also for Sam Smith.
If you aren't watching the Oscars with me but want to simulate the experience, throw a drink at your TV any time CAROL is up for an award.

Five years in, Rick Ross has come up an astonishing 11.55 million copies short on that claim.
"Rick Ross claimed if [50 Cent's] Get Rich or Die Tryin' sold 10 million... then his next record (Deeper than Rap) will sell 12 million."
I keep referring to Foxcatcher as "Catch For Us the Foxes" and giggling to myself because I am among the least cool people on earth.

I want to make this my pinned tweet so that people have to constantly reckon with that information.
"Trout is just 23 and has made about $2 million in his career, or the same amount Ryan Howard got paid for his first 13 games this season."

One thing you should know about me: I hear Drake saying "Shine on them hos" every time I jaywalk, especially in front of cops.

Through 7 movies/4 directors, the Fast/Furious series has a consistent "slow-motion upskirt shots of butts" aestethic they keep to. Kudos.
@KelseyPerpetua It is not; he does this. You've made it! He doesn't follow me, so can you tell him I think Go is a really dope movie?

Thank you for this. RT @danbarker Russell Brand's writing feels like someone is about to shout "PARKLIFE!" at the end of every sentence.
@SuriR "I'm so excited! I'm so excited! I'm so... scared!" is apt dialogue for either of those masterworks.
