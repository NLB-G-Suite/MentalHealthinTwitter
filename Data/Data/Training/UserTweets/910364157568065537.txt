that feeling of baled up nervousness in my belly. i should do tings that gives me that
running headfirst into my challenges will prob provide all of that.
i want to feel competent or that i'm on my way to competence
i want  to be comfortable enuff to leggo my sexuality
friends who will show me a diff way of life
i want friends who will look out for me and deal wid me how me deAL wid dem
i want a sexy body im proud of at some point
i want a life where i understand myself emotionally, my motivations
wah kinda metric taking ago work fi me
what is that new thin i'm trying ot grab on to? idk where i want to go in life. not making a decision is making a decision as well.
prob it need fi die so sumn new can grow in it's place. maybe me a hold on to a past thing fi too long and nuhbody naah go tell me fi leggo
haffi find someway fi mek this worthwhile without losing myself
a due to how jamaica stay still. college and acheibements praised as the only way and that a the only way people can see.
but the way tings set right now, it all just fuck up and everyhing a get pushed for the wrong reasons
prob that's what all these institutions are for. do it for them till u reach far enough to where you can do it for a greater cause
feels like me a do everything for the sake of doing it.
i can hold oonto life for. cause jah know idk the point anymore
haffi escape. whether by death or other means. them a kill the spark inside me. the flame barely alive. just smoulders. idk how long
they just waan hear ur probs fi know seh u have probs
only waan give the illusion of caring. prob that all them know fi do
them people yah nuh seem fi have the ability fi care as much as mi think they would
reality is way different than wah me have inna me head
if that alone me get praises for then me nuh muss hype it up
me neva choose fi be di favorite and cause school performance was the metric she get fuck
just some fucking support and understanding. ig u cyaan support me point me in the direction weh me can get weh me need.
dedicate me whole fucking life to passing tests and performing and this is how them end up a treat me when me just need likkle support
the amount of expectations u ago heap unto somebody must match the amount of support your willing to give

they breed this dependence thats fucked up
just get the vybe from dem like seh me a do everything wrong and me haffi get their feedback b4 me attempt ntn
so me know vybz is a real bloodklawt ting eno
prob never able to do all the things i did and make all the mistakes i'm making. they say it's okay but their actions tell otherwise
more while it feel like they subconciously resent me for living and 'suandering' the life they wished they were able to
like the fuckry of life just beat that out a them head.
is almost like they weren't kids, teenagers, young 20 year olds at 1 point
will i be like that? i dont want to be
what the fuck made them that way?
and this woman who avoids conflict at ALL costs and just keep everything in
weh convinced that everything he thinks is the reality
they dont let you in their lives. idk how to open up to people. feel like everybody si the enemy and this fucking delusional man
i barely know these people
more while it dont even feel like me have parents
it's bound to do that but if there's a greater connection then it would prob not have such an effect.
idk if im at a level of maturity where i can get that knowledge and not allow it to influence how i see them in a bad way
idk if i even want to know but i want to know.
SEEMS LIKE TINGS DID WELL ROUGH IN THAT ERA. i wish i understood the struggles they were coming from but they never want to share it.
this is fucking life bruh, mistakes ago always be made. you can choose how you ago take them
is like it's wrong to make mistakes
or if they acknowledge it they make sure i feel bad that they messed up
they dont admit when they messed up so they fashion it into a way where some of the blame is on me
how does that even make sense
and they shame me for living the life they provided for me
if they lived my life theyd be like me
stuff they know intuitively because that was what they had to focus on. i didn't live their life so i cant be like them
actually 80k. is like idkd ntn bout budgeting and discipline and all a dat and these people just expect me to know it
how do you spend 60k on food. in less than a month? this is a record.
and it';; automatically get better and improve
prob i dont have to. maybe thats the trick. just allow it to happen the way i allow the stuff i'm good at to happen
all these fuking things that every one else seems to know intuitively and i'm here having to focus on them all the time. exhausting as fuck
the private stage and the front stage
getting high allowed my vibe to shine through but the other vibe overwhelms it now
feels like i have a vibe that's trapped behind another vibe
can i blame them?
dinosoars who an't admit or acknowledge other view points. so stuck being an authority figure you cant imagine not having all the answers
this generation seems to be more about good mental health and seeing therapists which is amazing. i need that vibe in my life
kinda seems like my parents generation are hung up on all things mental health related
Each generation seems to chip away at some inhibitions of the previous generation.
Then they'll start acting how they think they should around a person who is sad and that reinforces the whole fucking thing.
down persons will act. it feels like a tension is there and if you don't conform they'll be like ohh i thought you were down/sad or w.e
Got me thinking about how weird it feels when you let someone know you're feeling down then is like you have to act in a way that they think

Treat persons as they are within the context of their actions.
That's messed up
A person isn't obligated to behave a certain way just because you treat them a certain way.
"Do shit for people" lol classic Ms./Mr. Nice girl/guy behaviour.

Feels so good to say the right things to get that smile across your face. It kills me inside when I have to go. But it kills me to stay...
I need you but I can't want you.
Allow persons to be peers in the context of their actions. Other wise out group.
Heaven and hell syndrome: the feeling that the consequences of every action will be his experience for eternity.
Heaven and he'll syndrome: the amazing feeling of happiness that explodes from your belly and the slow crushing torture of unmet expectation
It is the vomiting on an empty stomach inducing aftertaste left over after swallowing the consequences of my inaction
Maybe a product of the heaven &amp; hell
The thought that every action I make will be the last one I ever get to for the rest of eternity
It feels like  being stifled by the infinite

Pick on some one your own size
Farco rapid kill is like cologne for the bitch ass bugs.
Force you to see perspectives you wouldn't have known about otherwise
Friend(s) you can reason with about things you find appealing and important.
As mi reach in a bumboklawt mosquito dat.
Seasoned with a pinch of teasing per cupful of vibing.
Dropping slick pop culture reference bombs to sparks that chemistry.
Having the ability to express your thoughts and feelings in a way appropriate to your culture. With finesse &amp; style.
Another day another dollar.
I need to feel alive.
Right or wrong idc at this point.
I'm am choosing to make a choice.
Woke before classes ended. My day will be filled with learning experiences.

Damn.
I'm "choosing" to let my life "slip" away. I fear the consequences so i avoid the actions.
Am I overthinking this?
Is it as simple as just doing?
I put words to all the things I can blame my problems on so effortlessly.
The experience lifestyle
Listening music i can't relate to sparks my fomo. Fear that Idk how to quell.
More for you to experience, feel, immerse your soul in. I will be OK.

Corny philosophical talk is therapeutic.
Small pool of emotional lenses through which you can shine your reaction on life.
No tear syndrome. Found mostly in the males of the population. Results in reduced arsenal of emotions to display
I just need direction.
The  id at least have direction. I'd now know what not to do instead of struggling to find the path to take.
That I'm delusional. That I'm doing all this wrong.
More emotion than my words can comprehend. I wish or hope that I'm misinterpreting everything
Then what? The question that haunts my temples and echoes in the deepest recesses of my mind. The deafening silence of my mom's demands.
This feeling of not participating in my adolescence hurts. I always feel as if I'm missing out. Unable to concentrate on now due to then
What binds us all together? What makes something as unique as experience, familiar?
My wall.. My loneliness.. My oddity.. all unique to me but experienced by others.
I have evidence that my experiences are shared but it still can't penetrate my wall built from loneliness and oddity
I always wonder how normal I am.
I distill the experience down to a single phrase that guides my actions for a few days and if I like it, the  the high was worth it
Sometimes I feel so alive when high. All the stuff I need to do to live life how I want is unveiled and within grasp if only I just..
