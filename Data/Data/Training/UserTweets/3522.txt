@sheena_iyengar your talk at #naisac11 was excellent. I've been talking about it often since, and picked up your Kindle book. Thanks, much!
@bkolani @mbchalfen @stevebergen I like the idea of a TEDx or ed event whose purpose is to create something - let's practice collaboration
@circedunnell I looked around and felt it, too, but didn't want to assume. Hence I went to the #diversityscorecard as one way of "looking"
@lmsahistory Defining diversity is challenging. We know much of the edu/edutech space is largely white and male. Needs constant examination

"none of that is the stuff of test prep, all of that is the stuff of life prep" @willrich45 at #tedxnyed
listening to @willrich45 makes we wonder if I had $100,000,000 to give to education, how would I measure success? #tedxnyed
@bkolani thanks!
innovation can't just be about impact on students - we have to raise families up - Samona Tait at #tedxnyed
I realize that sending #diversityscorecard via Twitter only is creating a slanted segment. @TEDxNYED can you include it in post-conf e-mail?

"not going to be a computer revolution, there will be a computer evolution" - Steve Bergen at #tedxnyed
@edu_traveler most all of the people who started #tedxnyed work in independent schools, hence the network effect towards non-public schools
@bg_digerati sad, and too often the case. But if we recognize it, call attention to it, we can work on it
@kyraocity lunch was good. We spent so much time listening at #tedxnyed (although great), but needed to *do* something. Hence the survey

@amichetti electricity, table, and hopefully, like-minded folks. I think the first two are are more of the reason, though
the blgger's cafe at #TEDxNYED is much less active than ones I've been in at other conferences. Sort of odd
@georgeswain #TED doesn't allow for that format by their rules. Maybe we should leave their brand, or help them shift it #tedxnyed

@slazarotc second speaker seemed to be Arab American, no? #diversity is super complicated to define #tedxnyed
@jenksbyjenks I work in a 1:1 school, I know what tech brings us. My concerns are about schools/educators/students without access #tedxnyed
@jenksbyjenks depends on your definition of "accessible," right?
it's not just the place of elite schools to be talking about 21st century skills - @elemenous #tedxnyed
not for all boys RT @lizbdavis: @scieducation Working in a boys school - competition is very motivating. #tedxnyed

@bkolani the TEDx blog doesn't allow comments. I feel like they used to. Perhaps they're getting spammed too much.

the challenge with new media is there is no "right" way to use it. People use it in ways meaningful to them #tedxnyed

@bethstill no, it was "not working." My comment was, "great.". And now they just delayed us on the tarmac. Double great.

@mjmontagne good point. Is my mental model too limiting? Is theirs? #ncinnov8

@mjmontagne What does Korean 1 and 2 mean when taking in virtual school w different teachers? Scope and seq? #ncinnov8
another tip for speakers: always repeat the question for those who didn't hear #tip #speakers #conference
@krupali I wish I could. I am conference burned. Need to take mental care and decompress. For a few days, anyway :) #sxsw
We got a book to tell us about the virtual school #irony #ncinnov8
@mjmontagne I like that idea, especially for courses not offered at our school. Like obscure ones. I'm not sure how to teach them #ncinnov8
@dwillard @erniec they mentioned creation a bunch in the video commercial. Where was that? #ncinnov8
@jwsepke yes, great idea. How can they bring data from home, use the online space for analysis/synthesis/sharing #ncinnov8
I love the stock photos in this slideshow #ncinnov8

"students have the opportunity of choosing an avatar as their advisor" in new #NCAIS online classrooms at #ncinnov8. They talk funny :)
the real challenge is what are the tuition dollars going to if your students are taking classes online #ncinnov8
"we're LMS agnostic" - online ed vendor for #NCAIS at #ncinnov8. I like that.
RT @pjhiggins: Probably should have expected this, but the add-ons you would need for the iPad bring the price up near $800...
@dwillard @msstewart I agree, AP, SAT, but we still rarely talk about them like I've been hearing here #nysais #neit #ncinnov8
is handing out flash drives better (more environmentally friendly) than handing out paper? Cooler, at least #ncinnov8 #hmmm
congrats! Lots of us will be watching RT @raventech: NCAIS is the first state association to unveil a virtual learning program. #ncinnov8
noticeable discussion in North Carolina about "high stakes testing" that we just don't have in New York independent schools #ncinnov8
@amrowley I really like doing this through the state association. Now, how do I keep this off my plate ;) @barbaraswanson? #nysais #ncinnov8
@rkiker thanks for the #followfriday !
@amrowley I didn't understand why it was set in a sad tone. Shouldn't this be exciting? Also, it dogs classroom teachers, no? #strange
message to speakers: *always* use the microphone. Respect people with different hearing needs. #tip #speaking #conferences
fascinating that the NCAIS online ed program mirrors so many offline programs. Certification, tutoring,  high stakes test prep... #ncinnov8
