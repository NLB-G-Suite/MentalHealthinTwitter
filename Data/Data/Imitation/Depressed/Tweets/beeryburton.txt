Kylo Ren is just mad because his step dad Terry was having loud sex with Leia.
@XboxP3 Hey! So you know what would be awesome and super patriotic... Re-releasing Metal Wolf Chaos for the XBox One. Would sell millions.
@senden_ogu So how about Metal Wolf Chaos in North America? Yes? Please please please
RT @MrBrettBlake: Timex, bitch. #Timex2K16
Although Spencer didn't win.I think Jeremy deserved it.But just remember that he wouldn't be there if not for Spencer.

RT @MrBrettBlake: I think you are all beautiful. JK #GoFuckYourself
-Spencer (which one?) ((It's Hill... Duh))
@MrBrettBlake lol I'm the best.
@Caddicarus You're videos inspired me to replay all the Uncharted games again. I got no more papers due. Lets go https://t.co/cF6RMSfjcn
@MrBrettBlake close. But you are no goose good sir.
@MrBrettBlake  That day is now. Or was it yesterday? Or was your day tomorrow. Bah! Nevermind YOLO ya goof
@Caddicarus Hey, um. I notice that you have a plethora of PS1 games. I've trying to think of a specific PS1 game since grade 9.Can you help?
@astros As a Jays fan and I guy who hates the Yankees... Thank you. Thank you so much. I am an honorary fan. Unless you face my Jays ;)
@2BFLiam So somebody made 'john cena sexy high school adventure 2'. It's not Rustlemania. But any chance of even a short video on it?
Happy 14th birthday to Silent Hill 2 and Guy Cihi as Jaaaaammes Sunderland. It is a beauty of a game and I appreciate everyone who made it.
@burnie I didn't know you did ads for Via rail? In all honestly. I flew past it and got really confused. http://t.co/H6NDI0ItdY

ITTTTTTTT'S TIIIIME FOR THE #ageofrage
@MattMcMuscles  "He's taking them down with his #blackgift. Trending worldwide" 
You guys are my favourite. Thank you for everything.
Today I experimented with MOBAs and played Leauge and Smite. And I have decided to stick with Smite. I enjoyed it more. So that's a thing.
@MrBrettBlake that's it. It's been a long time since I saw the movie
@MattMcMuscles It's 10:27 PM. I'm up for it. Let's dreeeeeaaaaammm.
@MrBrettBlake Then he said my dog has to die.

You're dog has to die. *fart noise*
@MrBrettBlake And Wimp Lo the squeaky shoed man. Who just dies.
@MrBrettBlake Taiga. Taiga, Taiga,Taiga.
What's the second scroll?
Birrrdie. Birdie, Birdie
@MrBrettBlake that is true. But it is a trap that we can't escape. Like the tiny net from Kung Pow.
@MrBrettBlake It's cute. And it is nice. But I feel that the lustre would fade and it would devolve into people who don't want to grow up
@MrBrettBlake Yes they are great. Goals? No. But a great couple
@MrBrettBlake That show is great
@emilyhattonxo Good luck. It's a slag fest sometimes. But it gets pretty.
@MrBrettBlake otherwise it'd be weird and difficult. Oh well 18 is easy. It's 16.
@MrBrettBlake also it is rounded up. For ages like 19 where it becomes a .5
@MattMcMuscles Have a question about wrestling. I was just wondering if there was ever a wrestler that used Kid Rock as walk out music?
@Foxiify I'd watch the OG first just to get a grasp. Though brotherhood is better. The changes make watching brotherhood second the best bet
@Capcom_Unity Resident Evil 2 Remake! Why are you the greatest company ever? Because with all the stuff recently. It seems like you are hype
It's Rustlemania time. 

Let's get hyyyypppeeee! 
Time to go!
#Rustlemania2k15 #SuperBestFriends 

My Liam-Cena can't possibly be this cute.
@MrBrettBlake I'm game... Are you? http://t.co/3DR2hE31Mx
@MrBrettBlake He did, that is correct. But that is not sin worthy. Many worse idiosinracies.
@MrBrettBlake Thumb for texting and typing. Index for everything else.
@MrBrettBlake Ohhh okay. I do that, judge away
@MrBrettBlake  That's the pointer finger correct?
@marley_gernon Boy do I know the reverse of that all to well. Except mine isn't flirting. It's "Oh, I have a boyfriend".  Ohh relationships.
I always wished I could have seen the man in action. But for everything that you did for video games.I have a very heartfelt #ThankYouIwata
@unravel_game I'd just like to say that I am very excited for this game. It looks unique and cute. I thank you for believing and I'll buy it
@FunhausTeam You guys ever thought of playing music or rhythm games and calling it Funkhaus...

I'll let myself out. So sorry...
@Brocklevac @DanteUssoletti Do what you must. I mean yes please but it's alright in this context. Just don't like pictures of myself.
@Brocklevac @DanteUssoletti  Hi Brock.
@DanteUssoletti He is isn't okay. Okay cool then. Carry on.
@DanteUssoletti okay I won't just letting you know I'm here and I can see it so don't try anything. Aside from that, it is a good photo. Thx
@Brocklevac @DanteUssoletti That's a nice picture of me Brock. A shame it's on twitter. Really dude...
-Spencer
@Foxiify I agree. There is something oddly satisfyingly about watching people either be smart and manipulative to win... Or the town fail.
I'm glad that Dan and Mike got to be friends. That is a good ending to a story eh! #SurvivorFinale #Survivor
So today the new Life is Strange episode comes out and I am pumped. Easily one of my favorite new games out. Thanks @LifeIsStrange The best!
@AH_Michael Are you excited for the new banjo kazooie esq game being made?
So Yooka Laylee (the new banjo/kazooie esq game) has almost half a mil in backers. This is going to be great. #YookaLaylee
@Foxiify I own the same game for PS2. Just wait it gets worse once you have both characters. Then the shitty combat shines. God this game...
@GameGrumps This is for dan. A while ago you talked about Jodi Arias Thought you should know the ending. Well she got life in prison. Good.
@jacksearson Dude... What about all the memories you have. An outsider gonna take that away from us... No #Teamfox
@jacksearson So cuz. You know I am right. #Teamfox

@Capcom_Unity E3 is fast approaching can you give a hint about what to expect? Or just to wait and find out...

Just got a reply from Capcom!! this is the greatest day ever!!!! 
Also heard some rumours for RE7 and hoping they are true. God I love them!
@Capcom_Unity cont. Have you guys retconned Rebecca out of RE? she's my fav character and I was wondering if that's true. Or maybe RE7...

@Capcom_Unity Next Resident evil. released Feb.14th w/ jill. Get it 'Valentines day'. Bad pun none the less but I don't care just saying! :)
