The presence of the Holy Spirit at YoliJwa is out of this world. Phenomenal. This camp is a special place- camper &amp; counselor alike.
I'll forever be thankful &amp; blessed to have been a counselor this week. I'm inspired &amp; never want to ever stop serving.
I pray continuously that I can be a good role model &amp; mentor for them. My heart belongs at Camp YoliJwa.
Never have I ever had an experience like this and I want this week to have an everlasting impact. My girls are family now.
We grew together &amp; bonded so quickly in one week. Today? We cried. Some of my girls didn't want to let this week end, I didn't either.
I led girls closer to Jesus &amp; also assisted their pursuit of jelly bean poker. Red forty, wooooow, fun facts, icky boys. We covered it all.
In 7 short days I connected to 7 young girls on such a deep level. we lived together, laughed together, cried together. everything.
Being a camp counselor for the first time this week might have been the most rewarding experience I've ever had in my lifetime.

A week of camp will forever do your heart a favor.
It feels so good to hear from others that God shows through you. It's amazing. I'm so happy and excited to see how God uses me.
and how I have a heart for God that's extremely obvious. YOU BEST BELIEVE THE TEARS STARTED COMING.
AS I WAS LEAVING TODAY- she came up and gave me a huge hug and starting tearing up. She told me how much she appreciates me-
I went up to her afterwards and talked to her letting her know that her ability to be real and vulnerable with us is admirable.
She preached this week sharing her testimony which involved abortion &amp; why she's pro-life.
Sue from camp, what a lovely woman, pulled me aside as I was leaving and I swear my heart has never been so full.

we're sensitive. our feelings get hurt. don't allow things to happen that you aren't okay with. don't let someone have that effect on you.
you're not in the wrong to be hurt when someone else gets the compliments from the person who should be complimenting you, and you only.
breaks my heart seeing girls get heartbroken because they settled for less than what they deserved. don't. don't allow stupid excuses.
don't accept excuses as to why they're complimenting others. it's not stupid to be upset. you deserve all of someone's attention.

anytime we're stressed it's because our focus isn't on anything eternal. ask God to realign your priorities and you'll be amazed.
give every single ounce of your heart to God. tell him every single word on your mind. you'll go to sleep at night with a calm heart.

I have an unhealthy amount of salt in my personality.
just wait and maintain your morals. wait for the right attention that you get the right way. don't compromise. don't be classless.
and don't look for people to pity you. when you beg and plead for attention and get it in a bad way? that's your own doing.
you can't be attention thirsty and also demand respect. have self respect and respect others.
you beg for attention from anyone but when you get attention you complain because you're "being disrespected"? 
can't have it both ways.

you don't owe an explanation for why you feel things so much. it's a beautiful thing. you're experiencing life to the fullest- good &amp; bad.
don't be ashamed of your feelings. life is hard. life is overwhelming. letting that get to you isn't a "weakness". that's just life.
RT @panhead4_life: one 👏🏼 hour 👏🏼 until 👏🏼 Christmas 👏🏼 1st 👏🏼
feel your emotions. be upset. feel that disappointment. but build yourself from it. rely on God and let Him show his strength through you.
also- it's ok to cry. it's ok to not be ok. it's ok to be frustrated &amp; disappointed in yourself. just make sure that mindset isnt permanent.
school let's you down. appearance let's you down. the people "closest" to you let you down. nothing will satisfy you but Jesus.
the only thing in this world that won't disappoint you is Jesus.

Unreserved, unrestrained. Your love is wild- your love is wild for me.
so friends, seek God's love. it brings peace &amp; a calm mind. our hearts are anxious &amp; our minds are cluttered but God's love takes that away.
God's love brings peace. It brings protection. It brings comfort &amp; strength &amp; the all-consuming feeling of being wanted and being loved.
Lamentations 3:22-23 &amp; Philippians 4:6-7 come to mind when I listen to this song.
it's just a blessing that we can see the truth in that. God's love will never cause us to be anxious or restless or to have a troubled mind.
my favorite lyrics -- "Your love's my fractured, it's not a troubled mind. It isn't anxious, it's not the restless kind."
I have been listening to this song nonstop &amp; absolutely love love love it. Pieces by @bethelmusic. Wow.
Life is hard, school is stressful, things get you down. And the only thing that's been getting me through lately is that love.
The way that God's love is so consuming and overwhelming is the most comforting thing I've ever experienced.
