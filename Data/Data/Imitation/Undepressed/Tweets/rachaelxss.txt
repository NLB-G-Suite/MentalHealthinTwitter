everything that leaves is not a loss
self-harm isn’t such a taboo topic for me anymore, i’m way more open and comfortable to talk about it
i should be writing this down and not letting the world know but i know someone out there could probably relate so it’s worth it
i remember when cutting was one of the first options in my head whenever i wanted to stop feeling.. smh, that should never be an option
i wanted to have a period of time where i wasn’t feeling my pain today and instead of thinking to cut.. i thought to sleep..
sleeping makes me not think of my mental and or emotional pain therefore it’s doing the same job for me as self-harm did but.. healthier
i use to cut myself so that i wouldn’t have to think about my mental/emotional pain because i was too focused on my physical pain
this is just my thoughts &amp; experience but sleeping for me is lowkey kind of like self-harm for me but in a healthier way
sometimes sleep is the most peaceful time because i don’t have to feel... for a brief period of time i get a break from feeling
ever wanna go to sleep so you can stop feeling and thinking

don’t block your chances of happiness and growth because you’re scared of getting hurt, that fear is only hurting you more
don’t sell yourself short
follow a realistic way of living. just because people are doing these amazing things online doesn’t mean you necessarily have to to be happy
you’re going to have off days every now and then, that doesn’t mean you’ve failed or are going backwards though, it’s okay, don’t stress it
i hope everyone’s day is filled with beauty, realization, truth, humanity, uniqueness and of course most importantly love
that you have all given me, but just through youtube but on here in the vegan community. thank you to all who’s ever been kind to me
this month marks a year that i have been uploading content on my youtube channel and i’m just so thankful for the love and constant support

@ReneeRos1 you gotta come on the next trip!
@AmirahCreates i cannot relate to people lol
like what excuse do you have in which you "can't" be vegan that justifies MURDER........
u want to be vegan but u don't like veggies? great,i barely eat veggies &amp; i have been alive and thriving off a year &amp; 10 months of veganism
you wanna be vegan but don't have time to cook? great i've been vegan for almost two years and i don't cook, next excuse?
how you have time to watch reality shows and money to pop bottles every weekend but have no time (to research) or money to be vegan... 🙄
if you REALLY wanted to be vegan, you'd make time to do the research - for all y'all who claim your life is so busy you can't do research 🙄
RT @vegetablebum: **ALSO** "research" does not equal googling "why is being vegan bad" https://t.co/bJyihu2T5P
i'm just tired of people who don't even want to be vegan make excuses on how they "can't" be vegan... how does that make sense..
there's people who genuinely want to go vegan &amp; they try so hard to, they do the MOST they can. y'all fake people don't even make an attempt
because you cannot say you care enough to go vegan but make little to no attempt on it.. doesn't add up.. u could AT LEAST shop cruelty free
honestly a lot of the reasonings.. i mean excuses for why y'all "can't" go vegan just boils down to you just don't care enough.. admit it
there's teenagers w/unsupportive parents who found a way to be vegan but you can't find a way cause you honestly just don't care enough to
of course you "can't" go vegan if you never actually looked into it and don't even care enough to educate yourself on the topic
for all y'all who make excuses on why you "can't" go vegan, if you REALLY wanted to be vegan you would of done research on it &amp; found a way

sometimes you gotta talk yourself into a good mood
being heartless and negative is easy, being kind and compassionate despite the evil around you is true strength
empathy is important and these cold ass people will try and make you feel bad for it, don't let them

romantic relationships aren't everything in life, focus on yourself

you can't give others what you can't even give yourself.. take care of yourself first, love yourself first, everything will fall into place

so you can go ahead &amp; unfollow me.. like actually i beg of u to unfollow me if you're one of these vegans thank you 😘 keep saving the world
i think we should all be more ethical and i plan on doing so but that doesn't determine "how vegan you are"
everyone should be as ethical as they can be but using plastic and eating vegan meat doesn't make you any less of a vegan
everyday y'all got some new rule on being vegan - "if you eat vegan meat you ain't vegan"... like if y'all don't go somewhere
yes there are ways to be more ethical and healthy but just because you don't choose those ways it does not make you any less vegan
so if y'all could stop making up new rules on what vegans can and cannot do that'll be great
all i care about is if you go vegan and STAY vegan

you must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his destiny. if he abandons the pursuit, it's because it wasn't true love
it's true, life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny
"so why should i listen to my heart"
"because you'll never be able to keep it quiet"
the boy and his heart became friends, and neither was capable now of betraying the other
one is loved because one is loved. no reason is needed for loving
RT @herb_beauty: i've read it four times i honestly learn something new every time i read it https://t.co/bsq5uuCYoZ
whatever it is that u do,when u really want something,it's cause that desire originated in the soul of the universe.its ur mission on earth
it sucks causes some of their best quotes doesn't fit into 140 characters/: https://t.co/KZ44LFYxlV
people are afraid to pursue their most importante dreams,cause they feel that they don't deserve them,or that they'll be unable to achieve
it's one thing to feel that you are on the right path but it's another to think that yours is the only path
you will never be able to escape from your heart. so it's better to listen to what it has to say
everything that happens once can never happen again. but everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time
"why do we have to listen to our hearts?" the boy asked.
"because wherever your heart is, that is where you will find your treasure"
when each day is the same as the next,it's cause people fail to recognize the things that happen in their lives everyday that the sun rises
