May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI &amp; law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.
Heading into the 12 days with great negotiating strength because of our tremendous economy. 
It was a true honor to be at Yokota Air Base with our GREAT @USForcesJapan! 
Playing golf with Prime Minister Abe and Hideki Matsuyama, two wonderful people! 
Just gave a speech to the great men and women at Yokota Air Base in Tokyo, Japan. Leaving to see Prime Minister Abe.
